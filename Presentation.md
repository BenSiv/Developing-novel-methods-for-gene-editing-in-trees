**Title page**
My research was about developing novel methods for gene editing in trees.
The research was done in MIGAL, under the supervision od Dr. Amir Raz and Prof. Martin Goldway.

# Introduction

::: notes
I will give a short introduction just to get us up to pace.
There is lots of motivation to get more robust methods for gene editing for plant improvement.
The most used methods so far is the _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_ mediated transformation.
The most challenging step in the transformation is the regeneration from single cell to a whole plant. -> Tissue culture.
The main concept of novel gene editing methods is the target of in-planta transformation and regeneration.

Their are two methods my research focused on:
- Virus induced gene editing
- De-novo meristem induction and transformation

Virus induced gene editing utilises viruses for the systemic guide-RNA transfer in Cas9-OE plants. 
De-novo meristem induction and transformation is the use of developmental regulator genes for the regeneration of de-novo shoot in planta.

Now I will present each method
:::

# Virus Induced Gene Editing (VIGE)
## hypothesis

By infecting Cas9-OE plants with viral vector bearing sgRNA targeting endogenous gene, a tissue containing a knocked-out targeted gene will be obtained.

## Goal

To develop a new method for in-planta tree transformation and gene editing.

## Milstones

1. Generation of a Cas9-OE poplar plant using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

2. Contraction of viral vectors with sgRNA.

3. Contraction of viral vectors with sgRNA fused with mobile RNA sequence.

4. Observation of virus propagation.

5. Observation of mutations at the target sequence.

::: notes
The goal in both methods is the same.
Because this research is ambitious, I breaked down the goals to milestones to be able to rate the seccess.
:::

# Virus Induced Gene Editing (VIGE)
## Experiments layout

::: notes
Cas9-OE poplar -> infect with vector -> find mutation.
Cas9-OE apple -> infect with vector -> find mutation.
:::

# Virus Induced Gene Editing (VIGE)
## Results

::: notes
Have not been able to generate Cas9-OE poplar.
seccess => generated viral vectors with sgRNA.
seccess => generated viral vectors with sgRNA fused with mobile RNA sequence.
seccess => observed virus propagation.
seccess => observed mutation at the target sequence.

# Virus Induced Gene Editing (VIGE)
## Discussion and Conclusions

::: notes
This method have lots of potential, the most limiting factor is the prerequisite for Cas9-OE plant.
To date, new methods including virus harboring miniature Cas9 is able to overcome this prerequisite. Bright future ahead!

# De-novo meristem induction and transformation
## hypothesis

By infecting young plants with _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_ harboring T-DNA that contains DRs, CRISPR/Cas9 and sgRNA, it is possible to achieve de-novo shoot regeneration with knockout at the target gene.

## Goal

To develop a new method for in-planta tree transformation and gene editing.

## Milstones

1. Contraction of vectors with mix of DRs for shoot regeneration examination.

2. Achieve de-novo shoot regeneration as a result of the agro-infiltration.

3. Observe mutation in the target sequence. 

::: notes
The goal in both methods is the same.
Because this research is ambitious, I breaked down the goals to milestones to be able to rate the seccess.

# De-novo meristem induction and transformation
## Experiments layout

::: notes
contraction of plasmids -> infect of plants -> observed de-novo shoot regeneration -> find cassette in genome -> find mutation.
:::

# De-novo meristem induction and transformation
## Results

::: notes
seccess => contracted more than 21 plasmids.
seccess => infecting total of more than 1,500 plants.
seccess => observed 5 de-novo shoot regeneration.
seccess => observed 2 cotyledons like appearence.
seccess => observed 1 cassette integration.
seccess => worked with two specific DRs combinations, _WUS2-STM_ and _WOX11_STM_.

# De-novo meristem induction and transformation
## Discussion and Conclusions

::: notes
* works best in seedlings -> can explain  why in apples and not poplar.
* _STM_ and _WUS_ act in parallel in the regulation of SAM, and they are necessary for the normal expression of each other -> can explain  the DRs combination seccess, and non-deformed shoot formation.
* _WOX11_ is known to also regulate somatic embryogenesis -> can explain  the appearance of cotyledons-like leafs.
* the location of the regeneration site -> can explain
