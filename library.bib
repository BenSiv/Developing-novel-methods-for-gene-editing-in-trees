abstract = {Calcium chloride heat-shock transformation is a powerful molecular biology technique used to introduce foreign DNA into a host cell. The concept of the technique is to render cells competent using CaCl2 to allow for introduction of plasmid. Plasmids usually contain the gene(s) of interest in addition to selection and/or antibiotic resistance markers. The Hanahan or calcium chloride method is used to generate chemically competent cells. Heat-shocking facilitates the transport of plasmid into the competent cell. Transformed cells will allow for downstream applications such as plasmid amplification or protein expression. This methods paper will outline the protocol for the preparation of calcium competent Escherichia coli using the Hanahan method and heat-shock transformation of calcium competent Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {An efficient and reproducible system for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the pear (Pyrus communis L.) cultivar Spadona was developed. Leaf explants of in vitro propagated plants were cocultivated with the disarmed Agrobacterium strain EHA105 harboring the plasmid pME504, carrying the uidA-intron and nptII genes. Under selective conditions, 5{\%} of the plantlets regenerated and were positively stained for GUS. However, most of the GUS-positive plants re-callused and subsequently died, leaving only 0.3-0.8{\%} of these plantlets to reach maturity. In order to identify transformed shoots at early stages of regeneration, we introduced the green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the pear cultivar Spadona using the plasmid PZP carrying the nuclear-targeted GFP and nptII genes. High expression levels of GFP were detected in transgenic cells as early as 7 days after transformation. GFP marked-callii and transformed plants were observed after 14 and 24 days, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy screening of transformed plant material, under the selection of kanamycin, increased the transformation frequency to 3.0-4.0{\%}. We conclude that the introduction of GFP improves the selection of transformed plants of Spadona pear. {\textcopyright}Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {Endotoxins liberated by gram-negative bacteria are frequent contaminations of protein solutions derived from bioprocesses. Because of their high toxicity in vivo and in vitro, their removal is essential for a safe parenteral administration. A general method for the removal of endotoxins from protein solutions is not available. Methods used for decontamination of water, such as ultrafiltration, have little effect on endotoxin levels in protein solutions. Various techniques described in the patent literature are not broadly applicable, as they are tailored to meet specific product requirements. Besides ion-exchangers and two-phase extraction, affinity techniques are applied with varying success. Also, taylor-made endotoxin-selective adsorber matrices for the prevention of endotoxin contamination and endotoxin removal are discussed for this purpose. After giving an overview of the properties of endotoxins and the significance of endotoxin contamination, this review intends to provide an overall picture of the various methods employed for their removal. Avenues are pointed out how to optimise a method with regard to the specific properties of endotoxins in aqueous solution. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Plant gene editing is typically performed by delivering reagents such as Cas9 and single guide RNAs to explants in culture. Edited cells are then induced to differentiate into whole plants by exposure to various hormones. The creation of edited plants through tissue culture is often inefficient, time-consuming, works for only limited species and genotypes, and causes unintended changes to the genome and epigenome. Here we report two methods to generate gene-edited dicotyledonous plants through de novo meristem induction. Developmental regulators and gene-editing reagents are delivered to somatic cells of whole plants. This induces meristems that produce shoots with targeted DNA modifications, and gene edits are transmitted to the next generation. The de novo induction of gene-edited meristems sidesteps the need for tissue culture and promises to overcome a bottleneck in plant gene editing.},

abstract = {Chronic inflammation increases the risk of development of several types of malignancies including colon cancer. It also represents a paradigm for the connection between inflammation and cancer in terms of epidemiology and mechanistic studies in preclinical models. A key component of inflammation promoting cancer is the transcription factor NF-$\kappa$B, which is known to play a critical role in the regulation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene. iNOS is an enzyme dominantly expressed during inflammatory reactions. Although synthesis of high amounts of nitric oxide (NO) by iNOS has been demonstrated in pathophysiological processes, such as acute or chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis, the role of iNOS activity in these diseases is still not well understood. Analysis of human biopsies of colitis and colon cancer using immunohistochemistry revealed elevated iNOS protein expression levels, which were strongly paralleled by increased expression of nitrotyrosine suggesting that iNOS has been highly activated in these tissues. These results were corroborated in an in vitro study showing the presence of high iNOS levels in a colon cancer cell line (HT-29) following inflammatory stimuli (TNF-$\alpha$, peroxynitrite). In addition, the involvement of metastatic processes in the colon biopsies was assessed by means of in situ zymography of MMP activation. MMP 2 (gelatinase A) activation was higher in histopathological sections of colitis and cancer compared to controls. Overall, these data strengthen the findings that in inflammation and colon cancer in humans, iNOS expression and tyrosine nitration may be an indicator of cancer development and progression. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {We report a comprehensive toolkit that enables targeted, specific modification of monocot and dicot genomes using a variety of genome engineering approaches. Our reagents, based on transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, are systematized for fast, modular cloning and accommodate diverse regulatory sequences to drive reagent expression. Vectors are optimized to create either single or multiple gene knockouts and large chromosomal deletions. Moreover, integration of geminivirus-based vectors enables precise gene editing through homologous recombination. Regulation of transcription is also possible. A Web-based tool streamlines vector selection and construction. One advantage of our platform is the use of the Csy-type (CRISPR system yersinia) ribonuclease 4 (Csy4) and tRNA processing enzymes to simultaneously express multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs). For example, we demonstrate targeted deletions in up to six genes by expressing 12 gRNAs from a single transcript. Csy4 and tRNA expression systems are almost twice as effective in inducing mutations as gRNAs expressed from individual RNA polymerase III promoters. Mutagenesis can be further enhanced 2.5-fold by incorporating the Trex2 exonuclease. Finally, we demonstrate that Cas9 nickases induce gene targeting at frequencies comparable to native Cas9 when they are delivered on geminivirus replicons. The reagents have been successfully validated in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), Medicago truncatula, wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare).},

abstract = {Background. Our aim is to improve knowledge of gene regulatory circuits important to dedifferentiation, redifferentiation, and adventitious meristem organization during in vitro regeneration of plants. Regeneration of transgenic cells remains a major obstacle to research and commercial deployment of most taxa of transgenic plants, and woody species are particularly recalcitrant. The model woody species Populus, due to its genome sequence and amenability to in vitro manipulation, is an excellent species for study in this area. The genes recognized may help to guide the development of new tools for improving the efficiency of plant regeneration and transformation. Results. We analyzed gene expression during poplar in vitro dedifferentiation and shoot regeneration using an Affymetrix array representing over 56,000 poplar transcripts. We focused on callus induction and shoot formation, thus we sampled RNAs from tissues: prior to callus induction, 3 days and 15 days after callus induction, and 3 days and 8 days after the start of shoot induction. We used a female hybrid white poplar clone (INRA 717-1 B4, Populus tremula × P. alba) that is used widely as a model transgenic genotype. Approximately 15{\%} of the monitored genes were significantly up-or down-regulated when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.01; over 3,000 genes had a 5-fold or greater change in expression. We found a large initial change in expression after the beginning of hormone treatment (at the earliest stage of callus induction), and then a much smaller number of additional differentially expressed genes at subsequent regeneration stages. A total of 588 transcription factors that were distributed in 45 gene families were differentially regulated. Genes that showed strong differential expression included components of auxin and cytokinin signaling, selected cell division genes, and genes related to plastid development and photosynthesis. When compared with data on in vitro callogenesis in Arabidopsis, 25{\%} (1,260) of up-regulated and 22{\%} (748) of down-regulated genes were in common with the genes regulated in poplar during callus induction. Conclusion. The major regulatory events during plant cell organogenesis occur at early stages of dedifferentiation. The regulatory circuits reflect the combinational effects of transcriptional control and hormone signaling, and associated changes in light environment imposed during dedifferentiation. {\textcopyright}2009 Bao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims The cancer stem cells (CSCs) have important therapeutic implications for multi-resistant cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Among the key pathways frequently activated in liver CSCs is NF-$\kappa$B signaling. Methods We evaluated the CSCs-depleting potential of NF-$\kappa$B inhibition in liver cancer achieved by the IKK inhibitor curcumin, RNAi and specific peptide SN50. The effects on CSCs were assessed by analysis of side population (SP), sphere formation and tumorigenicity. Molecular changes were determined by RT-qPCR, global gene expression microarray, EMSA, and Western blotting. Results HCC cell lines exposed to curcumin exhibited differential responses to curcumin and were classified as sensitive and resistant. In sensitive lines, curcumin-mediated induction of cell death was directly related to the extent of NF-$\kappa$B inhibition. The treatment also led to a selective CSC-depletion as evidenced by a reduced SP size, decreased sphere formation, down-regulation of CSC markers and suppressed tumorigenicity. Similarly, NF-$\kappa$B inhibition by SN50 and siRNA against p65 suppressed tumor cell growth. In contrast, curcumin-resistant cells displayed a paradoxical increase in proliferation and expression of CSC markers. Mechanistically, an important component of the CSC-depleting activity of curcumin could be attributed to a NF-$\kappa$B-mediated HDAC inhibition. Co-administration of the class I/II HDAC inhibitor trichostatine sensitized resistant cells to curcumin. Further, integration of a predictive signature of curcumin sensitivity with human HCC database indicated that HCCs with poor prognosis and progenitor features are most likely to benefit from NF-$\kappa$B inhibition. Conclusions These results demonstrate that blocking NF-$\kappa$B can specifically target CSC populations and suggest a potential for combined inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B and HDAC signaling for treatment of liver cancer patients with poor prognosis.},

abstract = {Maize is the principal grain crop of the world. It is also the crop where genetic engineering has been employed to a great extent to improve its various traits. The ability to transform maize is a crucial step for application of gene technology in maize improvement. There have been constant improvements in the maize transformation technologies over past several years. The choice of genotype and the explant material to initiate transformation and the different types of media to be used in various stages of tissue culture can have significant impact on the outcomes of the transformation efforts. Various methods of gene transfer, like the particle bombardment, protoplast transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated, in planta transformation, etc., have been tried and improved over years. Similarly, various selection systems for retrieval of the transformants have been attempted. The commercial success of maize transformation and transgenic development is unmatched by any other crop so far. Maize transformation with newer gene editing technologies is opening up a fresh dimension in transformation protocols and work-flows. This review captures the various past and recent facets in improvement in maize transformation technologies and attempts to present a comprehensive updated picture of the current state of the art in this area.},

abstract = {Pakistan is vulnerable to climate change, and extreme climatic conditions are threatening food security. This study examines the effects of climate change (e.g., maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and the sunshine) on the major crops of Pakistan (e.g., wheat, rice, maize, and sugarcane). The methods of feasible generalized least square (FGLS) and heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation (HAC) consistent standard error were employed using time series data for the period 1989 to 2015. The results of the study reveal that maximum temperature adversely affects wheat production, while the effect of minimum temperature is positive and significant for all crops. Rainfall effect towards the yield of a selected crop is negative, except for wheat. To cope with and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, there is a need for the development of heat- and drought-resistant high-yielding varieties to ensure food security in the country.},

We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.},

However, only in the past two decades has the ability of Agrobacterium to transfer DNA to plant cells been harnessed for the purposes of plant genetic engineering. Since the initial reports in the early 1980s using Agrobacterium to generate transgenic plants, scientists have attempted to improve this "natural genetic engineer" for biotechnology purposes. Some of these modifications have resulted in extending the host range of the bacterium to economically important crop species. However, in most instances, major improvements involved alterations in plant tissue culture transformation and regeneration conditions rather than manipulation of bacterial or host genes. Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is a highly complex and evolved process involving genetic determinants of both the bacterium and the host plant cell. In this article, I review some of the basic biology concerned with Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Knowledge of fundamental biological principles embracing both the host and the pathogen have been and will continue to be key to extending the utility of Agrobacterium for genetic engineering purposes.},

abstract = {Imatinib mesylate, Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has improved the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+)ALL). However, resistance is often reported in patients with advanced-stage disease. Several novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which have been developed to override imatinib resistance mechanisms such as overexpression of Bcr-Abl and point mutations within the Abl kinase domain, are currently competing. Inhibitors of Abl tyrosine kinase are divided into two main groups, namely, ATP-competitive and ATP non-competitive inhibitors. Moreover, ATP-competitive inhibitors are fall into two subclasses, i.e. the Src/Abl inhibitors, and 2-phenylaminopyrimidin-based compounds. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825), AP23464, SKI-606 and PD166326 are classified as Src/Abl inhibitors while AMN107 and NS-187 (INNO-406) belong to the latter subclass of inhibitors. Among these agents, clinical studies on dasatinib and AMN107 had started earlier than the others and favorable results are accumulating. Clinical studies of other compounds including NS-187 (INNO-406) will be performed in rapid succession. Because of its strong affinity, most ATP competitive inhibitors may be effective against imatinib-resistant patients. However, to date, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that can inhibit the phosphorylation of T315I Bcr-Abl has not yet been developed. To address this problem, ATP non-competitive inhibitors such as ON012380, Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor BIRB-796 have been developed. It may be necessary for the improvement of CML and Ph(+)ALL treatment to be taken into consideration of the combination therapy with novel ATP-competitive inhibitors and these agents.},

abstract = {Targeted genome engineering has emerged as an alternative to classical plant breeding and transgenic methods to improve crop plants. Among other methods (zinc finger nucleases or TAL effector nucleases) the CRISPR-Cas system proved to be the most effective, convenient and least expensive method. In this study, we optimized the conditions of application of this system on apple and explored its feasibility on pear. As a proof of concept, we chose to knockout the Phytoene Desaturase (PDS) and Terminal Flower 1 (TFL1) genes. To improve the edition efficiency, two different single guide RNAs (gRNAs) were associated to the Cas9 nuclease for each target gene. These gRNAs were placed under the control of the U3 and U6 apple promoters. Characteristic albino phenotype was obtained for 85{\%} of the apple transgenic lines targeted in MdPDS gene. Early flowering was observed in 93{\%} of the apple transgenic lines targeted in MdTFL1.1 gene and 9{\%} of the pear transgenic lines targeted in PcTFL1.1. Sequencing of the target zones in apple and pear CRISPR-PDS and CRISPR-TFL1.1 transgenic lines showed that the two gRNAs induced mutations but at variable frequencies. In most cases, Cas9 nuclease cut the DNA in the twenty targeted base pairs near the protospacer adjacent motif and insertions were more frequent than deletions or substitutions. The most frequent edition profile of PDS as well as TFL1.1 genes was chimeric biallelic. Analysis of a sample of potential off-target sequences of the CRISPR-TFL1.1 construct indicated the absence of edition in cases of three mismatches. In addition, transient transformation with the CRISPR-PDS construct produced two T-DNA free edited apple lines. Our overall results indicate that, despite the frequent occurrence of chimerism, the CRISPR-Cas 9 system is a powerful and precise method to induce targeted mutagenesis in the first generation of apple and pear transgenic lines.},

Furthermore, the development of protein templates that are stable under extreme conditions of heat or chemical denaturants will expand processing conditions and end-use applications for biomaterials that require exceptional stability and robustness. In the present work, we characterized the high thermal stability of a filamentous protein template, the $\gamma$-prefoldin ($\gamma$PFD) from the hyperthermophile Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, and subsequently used rational design to further enhance the filament's thermal stability for application as a biotemplate in the creation of platinum nanowires. The $\gamma$PFD assembles into long fibers with lengths that exceed 2 $\mu$m, which when heated to various temperatures and examined by transmission electron microscopy, revealed a T(m) of 93°C for the quaternary filament structure. Subsequently, we increased the hydrophobicity of the $\alpha$-helices of the $\gamma$PFD's coiled-coil, which appeared to strengthen the filamentous structure, leading to filaments of greater length at elevated temperatures. These enhanced filaments functioned as templates for the synthesis of platinum nanowires at unprecedented temperatures, and may create new opportunities for other applications of nanoscale biotemplates that require exceptional thermal stability.

abstract = {Background: Transient gene expression via Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer offers a simple and fast method to analyze transgene functions. Although Arabidopsis is the most-studied model plant with powerful genetic and genomic resources, achieving highly efficient and consistent transient expression for gene function analysis in Arabidopsis remains challenging.Results: We developed a highly efficient and robust Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system, named AGROBEST (Agrobacterium-mediated enhanced seedling transformation), which achieves versatile analysis of diverse gene functions in intact Arabidopsis seedlings. Using {\$}\beta{\$}-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation assay, we show that the use of a specific disarmed Agrobacterium strain with vir gene pre-induction resulted in homogenous GUS staining in cotyledons of young Arabidopsis seedlings. Optimization with AB salts in plant culture medium buffered with acidic pH 5.5 during Agrobacterium infection greatly enhanced the transient expression levels, which were significantly higher than with two existing methods. Importantly, the optimized method conferred 100{\%} infected seedlings with highly increased transient expression in shoots and also transformation events in roots of {\~{}}70{\%} infected seedlings in both the immune receptor mutant efr-1 and wild-type Col-0 seedlings. Finally, we demonstrated the versatile applicability of the method for examining transcription factor action and circadian reporter-gene regulation as well as protein subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions in physiological contexts.Conclusions: AGROBEST is a simple, fast, reliable, and robust transient expression system enabling high transient expression and transformation efficiency in Arabidopsis seedlings. Demonstration of the proof-of-concept experiments elevates the transient expression technology to the level of functional studies in Arabidopsis seedlings in addition to previous applications in fluorescent protein localization and protein-protein interaction studies. In addition, AGROBEST offers a new way to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer. {\textcopyright}2014 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {A dwarf mutant (dwf1) was obtained among 15 transgenic lines, when TaLEA (Tamarix androssowii late embryogenesis abundant gene) was introduced into Populus simonii × Populus nigra by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Under the same growth conditions, dwf1 height was significantly reduced compared with the wild type and the other transgenic lines. Because only one transgenic line (dwf1) displayed the dwarf phenotype, we considered that T-DNA insertion sites may play a role in the mutant formation. The mechanisms underlying this effect were investigated using TAIL-PCR (thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR) and microarrays methods. According to the TAIL-PCR results, two flanking sequences located on chromosome IV and VIII respectively, were cloned. The results indicated the integration of two independent T-DNA copies. We searched for the potential genes near to the T-DNA insertions. The nearest gene was a putative poplar AP2 transcription factor (GI: 224073210). Expression analysis showed that AP2 was up-regulated in dwf1 compared with the wild type and the other transgenic lines. According to the microarrays results, a total of 537 genes involved in hydrolase, kinase and transcription factor activities, as well as protein and nucleotide binding, showed significant alterations in gene expression. These genes were expressed in more than 60 metabolic pathways, including starch, sucrose, galactose and glycerolipid metabolism and phenylpropanoids and flavonoid biosyntheses. Our transcriptome and T-DNA insertion sites analyses might provide some useful insights into the dwarf mutant formation. {\textcopyright}2012 by the authors.},

abstract = {Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has been shown to be an effective tool for investigating gene functions in herbaceous plant species, but has rarely been tested in trees. The establishment of a fast and reliable transformation system is especially important for woody plants, many of which are recalcitrant to transformation. In this study, we established a tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based VIGS system for two Populus species, Populus euphratica and P. × canescens. Here, TRV constructs carrying a 266 bp or a 558 bp fragment of the phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene were Agrobacterium-infiltrated into leaves of the two poplar species. Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of the shorter insert, TRV2-PePDS266, into the host poplars resulted in expected photobleaching in both tree species, but not the longer insert, PePDS558. The efficiency of VIGS was temperature-dependent, increasing by raising the temperature from 18 to 28 C. The optimized TRV-VIGS system at 28 C resulted in a high silencing frequency and efficiency up to 65-73 and 83-94{\%}, respectively, in the two tested poplars. Moreover, syringe inoculation of Agrobacterium in 100 mM acetosyringone induced a more efficient silencing in the two poplar species, compared with other agroinfiltration methods, e.g., direct injection, misting and agrodrench. There were plant species-related differences in the response to VIGS because the photobleaching symptoms were more severe in P. × canescens than in P. euphratica. Furthermore, VIGS-treated P. euphratica exhibited a higher recovery rate (50{\%}) after several weeks of the virus infection, compared with TRV-infected P. × canescens plants (20{\%}). Expression stability of reference genes was screened to assess the relative abundance of PePDS mRNA in VIGS-treated P. euphratica and P. × canescens. PeACT7 was stably expressed in P. euphratica and UBQ-L was selected as the most suitable reference gene for P. × canescens using three different statistical approaches, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. Quantitative real-time PCR showed significant reductions in PDS transcripts (55-64{\%}) in the photobleached leaves of both VIGS-treated poplar species. Our results demonstrate that the TRV-based VIGS provides a practical tool for gene functional analysis in Populus sp., especially in those poplar species which are otherwise recalcitrant to transformation.},

abstract = {Bacterial pathogens utilize a multitude of methods to invade mammalian hosts, damage tissue sites, and thwart the immune system from responding. One essential component of these strategies for many bacterial pathogens is the secretion of proteins across phospholipid membranes. Secreted proteins can play many roles in promoting bacterial virulence, from enhancing attachment to eukaryotic cells, to scavenging resources in an environmental niche, to directly intoxicating target cells and disrupting their functions. Many pathogens use dedicated protein secretion systems to secrete virulence factors from the cytosol of the bacteria into host cells or the host environment. In general, bacterial protein secretion apparatuses can be divided into classes, based on their structures, functions, and specificity. Some systems are conserved in all classes of bacteria and secrete a broad array of substrates, while others are only found in a small number of bacterial species and/or are specific to only one or a few proteins. In this chapter, we review the canonical features of several common bacterial protein secretion systems, as well as their roles in promoting the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Additionally, we address recent findings that indicate that the innate immune system of the host can detect and respond to the presence of protein secretion systems during mammalian infection.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions is derived mostly from studies of model annual plant species, and until recently, few addressed disease resistance and defense responses in long-lived species such as trees. The release of the Populus genome sequence has permitted extensive genome-wide surveys of gene families and comparative analyses of other sequenced plant genomes. These have revealed striking features for gene families that play key roles in the plant defense response. For example, the NBS-LRR resistance (R)-gene family is expanded compared with other plant genomes, including R-gene subfamilies not previously reported in plants. Some of these genes are clustered on the subtelomeric part of a chromosome that shows segregation distortion in genetic studies. Similar expansion is observed for other genes playing key roles in plant defense such as pathogenesis-related proteins. Among the many pathogens that infect poplar trees, Melampsora spp. fungi, which cause rust diseases in plants, are responsible for considerable damage in poplar plantations. This biotrophic pathogen has attracted recent attention and here we describe molecular insights into the Populus defense response against rust infection. Transcript profiles derived from compatible (susceptible) and incompatible (specific host -resistance) Populus-Melampsora interactions were leveraged to describe molecular changes occurring during defense responses against rust fungi. This highlighted responses that are similar to defense responses of annual plant species, such as up-regulation of transcripts encoding pathogenesis-related proteins. The molecular evidence gathered for the poplar-rust pathosystem indicates a temporal delay in the activation of defense responses between susceptibility and partial or full resistance that is consistent with the signal conversion model described for Arabidopsis. The genome of Melampsora larici-populina, which infects several species of Populus, was recently sequenced and provides a model pathosystem for forest pathology and offers unprecedented opportunities to understand how tree species cope with disease. Ultimately, understanding the molecular basis of Populus rust resistance will greatly improve our understanding of other major diseases of poplar. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

The ability to transform maize is a crucial step for application of gene technology in maize improvement. There have been constant improvements in the maize transformation technologies over past several years. The choice of genotype and the explant material to initiate transformation and the different types of media to be used in various stages of tissue culture can have significant impact on the outcomes of the transformation efforts. Various methods of gene transfer, like the particle bombardment, protoplast transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated, in planta transformation, etc., have been tried and improved over years. Similarly, various selection systems for retrieval of the transformants have been attempted. The commercial success of maize transformation and transgenic development is unmatched by any other crop so far. Maize transformation with newer gene editing technologies is opening up a fresh dimension in transformation protocols and work-flows. This review captures the various past and recent facets in improvement in maize transformation technologies and attempts to present a comprehensive updated picture of the current state of the art in this area.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To evaluate the predictive factors for the development of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants and to study the morbidities associated with the treatment of PDA during the first hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected from the Finnish national register of preterm infants ({\textless}32 gestational weeks) born in 2005-2013. In total, 3668 infants were included. Morbidities during the first hospitalization were analysed and compared between infants who received treatments for the closure of PDA (n = 1132) and infants who received no treatment for PDA (n = 2536). The results were adjusted for the duration of pregnancy, intrauterine growth pattern, antenatal steroids, delivery hospital and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RESULTS RDS and mechanical ventilation were independently associated with an increased risk of PDA requiring treatment. Medical and surgical treatments were associated with the risk of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Primary surgical ligation was associated with an increased risk of severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Medical treatment itself and also followed by surgical ligation was associated with lower mortality. CONCLUSION The severity of lung disease rather than prematurity per se was associated with the development of PDA requiring therapy. Both medical and surgical therapies for PDA were associated with severe BPD, and primary surgical ligation was associated with NEC and severe IVH.},

abstract = {Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an effective tool for studying the functions of plant genes, but only a few VIGS vectors available for woody plants were reported so far. Here we present an effective heterologous VIGS system in woody plants based on tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vectors. We first tested whether the TRV-vector can be directly applied to infect woody plant species, such as Vernicia fordii, Populus tomentosa Carr. and Camellia oleifera. The results revealed that TRV-mediated VIGS could be effectively elicited in V. fordii, weakly in P. tomentosa Carr., but not in C. oleifera. TRV-based VIGS vectors with heterologous phytoene desaturase (PDS) sequences from various woody plant species silenced successfully the endogenous PDS gene in Nicotina benthamiana and V. fordii. The photobleached leaf phenotype of silenced plants significantly correlated with the down-regulation of endogenous PDS as compared with controls. To further confirm the reliability of VIGS in V. fordii, we also isolated the cloroplastos alterados 1 gene from P. tomentosa Carr., and the silencing pheotypes of albino leaves were observed in V. fordii 2 weeks after inoculation using a heterologous TRV-based VIGS system. Taken together, we have successfully developed an Agrobacterium-mediated VIGS assay in V. fordii and demonstrated that V. fordii as a heterologous VIGS system provides a valuable tool for functional genomic analysis in woody plant species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Nonetheless, due to lack of multiple insertion sites in these plant viruses, it is still a big challenge to simultaneously express multiple foreign proteins in single cells. The genome of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) offers an attractive system for expression of multiple foreign proteins owning to a multipartite genome composed of five positive-stranded RNAs. Here, we have established a BNYVV full-length infectious cDNA clone under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. We further developed a set of BNYVV-based vectors that permit efficient expression of four recombinant proteins, including some large proteins with lengths up to 880 amino acids in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana and native host sugar beet plants. These vectors can be used to investigate the subcellular co-localization of multiple proteins in leaf, root and stem tissues of systemically infected plants. Moreover, the BNYVV-based vectors were used to deliver NbPDS guide RNAs for genome editing in transgenic plants expressing Cas9, which induced a photobleached phenotype in systemically infected leaves. Collectively, the BNYVV-based vectors will facilitate genomic research and expression of multiple proteins, in sugar beet and related crop plants.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rate of self-assembly was significantly enhanced by applying a nanomechanical stimulus using atomic force microscopy. The orientation of the newly grown nanofibers was mostly perpendicular to the scanning direction, implying that the new fiber assembly was locally activated with directional control. Our method provides a novel way to prepare nanofiber patterned substrates using a bottom-up approach.},

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

abstract = {Type II secretion (T2S) is one means by which Gram-negative pathogens secrete proteins into the extracellular milieu and/or host organisms. Based upon re-cent genome sequencing, it is clear that T2S is largely restricted to the Proteobacte-ria, occurring in many, but not all, genera in the Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobac-teria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria classes. Prominent human and/or animal pathogens that express a T2S system(s) include Acinetobacter baumannii, Burk-holderia pseudomallei, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica. T2S-expressing plant pathogens include Dickeya da-dantii, Erwinia amylovora, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Ralstonia solanacearum, Xan-thomonas campestris, Xanthomonas oryzae, and Xylella fastidiosa. T2S also occurs in nonpathogenic bacteria, facilitating symbioses, among other things. The output of a T2S system can range from only one to dozens of secreted proteins, encompassing a diverse array of toxins, degradative enzymes, and other effectors, including novel proteins. Pathogenic processes mediated by T2S include the death of host cells, degradation of tissue, suppression of innate immunity, adherence to host surfaces, biofilm formation, invasion into and growth within host cells, nutrient assimilation, and alterations in host ion flux. The reach of T2S is perhaps best illustrated by those bacteria that clearly use it for both environmental survival and virulence; e.g., L. pneumophila employs T2S for infection of amoebae, growth within lung cells, damp-ening of cytokines, and tissue destruction. This minireview provides an update on the types of bacteria that have T2S, the kinds of proteins that are secreted via T2S, and how T2S substrates promote infection.},

abstract = {Most research linking global environmental change and food security focuses solely on agriculture: either the impact of climate change on agricultural production, or the impact of agriculture on the environment, e.g. on land use, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and/or biodiversity. Important though food production is, many other factors also need to be considered to understand food security. A recent international conference on "Environmental Change and Food Security: Bridging Science, Policy and Development for Adaptation" included a range of papers that embraced the multiple dimensions of the food systems that underpin food security. The major conclusion from the conference was that technical fixes alone will not solve the food security challenge. Adapting to the additional threats to food security arising from major environmental changes requires an integrated food system approach, not just a focus on agricultural practices. Six key issues emerged for future research: (i) adapting food systems to global environmental change requires more than just technological solutions to increase agricultural yields; (ii) tradeoffs across multiple scales among food system outcomes are a pervasive feature of globalized food systems; (iii) within food systems, there are some key underexplored areas that are both sensitive to environmental change but also crucial to understanding its implications for food security and adaptation strategies; (iv) scenarios specifically designed to investigate the wider issues that underpin food security and the environmental consequences of different adaptation options are lacking; (v) price variability and volatility often threaten food security; and (vi) more attention needs to be paid to the governance of food systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Dramatic reductions in mortality, followed (but with a lag) by equally marked reductions in fertility, resulted in a doubling of world population between 1960 and 2000. A further increase of 2 to 4.5 billion is projected for the current half-century, with the increase concentrated in the world's least developed countries. Despite alarmist predictions, historical increases in population have not been economically catastrophic. Moreover, changes in population age structure have opened the door to increased prosperity. Demographic changes have had and will continue to have profound repercussions for human well-being and progress, with some possibilities for mediating those repercussions through policy intervention.},

abstract = {Poplar is a model system for the regeneration and genetic transformation of woody plants. To shorten the time required for studies of transgenic poplar, efforts have been made to optimize transformation methods that use Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In this study, an Agrobacterium infective suspension was treated at 4 °C for at least 10 h before infecting explants. By transforming the Populus hybrid clone "Nanlin895" (Populus deltoides × P. euramericana) with Agrobacterium harboring the PBI121:CarNAC6 binary vector, we showed that the transformation efficiency was improved significantly by multiple independent factors, including an Agrobacterium infective suspension with an OD600 of 0.7, an Agrobacterium infection for 120 min, an Agrobacterium infective suspension at a pH of 5.0, an acetosyringone concentration of 200 {\$}\mu{\$}M, a cocultivation at 28 °C, a cocultivation for 72 h and a sucrose concentration of 30 g/L in the cocultivation medium. We also showed that preculture of wounded leaf explants for two days increased the regeneration rate. The integration of the desired gene into transgenic poplars was detected using selective medium containing kanamycin, followed by southern blot analysis. The expression of the transgene in the transgenic lines was confirmed by northern blot analysis. {\textcopyright}2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a powerful tool for identifying gene functions in plants. Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated VIGS has been reported for silencing of endogenous genes in many plants. In citrus, analysis of gene function is mainly relied on the table genetic transformation, even though this technique is low-efficiency and time-consuming. In this study, a TRV-mediated VIGS was successfully applied for verification of gene function in citrus. A reporter gene, Magnesium chelatase subunit I (ChlI) from C. grandis was constructed into TRV2 vector to induce gene silencing with visible photobleaching symptom. TRV VIGS induced photobleaching symptom was observed on the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and Citrus after infiltration. The susceptibility to VIGS vector was found to be genotype dependent. Mexican lemon is the most susceptible one. The chlorosis area per leaf was 65.5{\%} of the whole leaf area. GXSTY pummelo exhibited less susceptible to VIGS with only tiny patches of chlorosis appeared on the leaves of treated plants. The parameters were optimized to improve the efficiency. The tiny young leaves and half expanded leaves were more susceptible to VIGS infection. Young seedlings were highly susceptible to vacuum infiltration. The expression of fluorescence from GFP reporter gene was observed in the young seedlings of GXSTY after infiltration with TRV. Close to 100{\%} of infiltration efficiency was achieved by vacuum infiltration. The results indicated that TRV mediated VIGS with vacuum infiltration could be an ideal tool for gene function studies in citrus.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Bacteria have acquired multiple systems to expose proteins on their surface, release them in the extracellular environment or even inject them into a neighboring cell. Protein secretion has a high adaptive value and secreted proteins are implicated in many functions, which are often essential for bacterial fitness. Several secreted proteins or secretion machineries have been extensively studied as potential drug targets. It is therefore important to identify the secretion substrates, to understand how they are specifically recognized by the secretion machineries, and how transport through these machineries occurs. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the biochemical, genetic and imaging tools that have been developed to evaluate protein secretion in a qualitative or quantitative manner. After a brief overview of the different tools available, we will illustrate their advantages and limitations through a discussion of some of the current open questions related to protein secretion. We will start with the question of the identification of secreted proteins, which for many bacteria remains a critical initial step toward a better understanding of their interactions with the environment. We will then illustrate our toolbox by reporting how these tools have been applied to better understand how substrates are recognized by their cognate machinery, and how secretion proceeds. Finally, we will highlight recent approaches that aim at investigating secretion in real time, and in complex environments such as a tissue or an organism.},

abstract = {A dwarf mutant (dwf1) was obtained among 15 transgenic lines, when TaLEA (Tamarix androssowii late embryogenesis abundant gene) was introduced into Populus simonii × Populus nigra by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Under the same growth conditions, dwf1 height was significantly reduced compared with the wild type and the other transgenic lines. Because only one transgenic line (dwf1) displayed the dwarf phenotype, we considered that T-DNA insertion sites may play a role in the mutant formation. The mechanisms underlying this effect were investigated using TAIL-PCR (thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR) and microarrays methods. According to the TAIL-PCR results, two flanking sequences located on chromosome IV and VIII respectively, were cloned. The results indicated the integration of two independent T-DNA copies. We searched for the potential genes near to the T-DNA insertions. The nearest gene was a putative poplar AP2 transcription factor (GI: 224073210). Expression analysis showed that AP2 was up-regulated in dwf1 compared with the wild type and the other transgenic lines. According to the microarrays results, a total of 537 genes involved in hydrolase, kinase and transcription factor activities, as well as protein and nucleotide binding, showed significant alterations in gene expression. These genes were expressed in more than 60 metabolic pathways, including starch, sucrose, galactose and glycerolipid metabolism and phenylpropanoids and flavonoid biosyntheses. Our transcriptome and T-DNA insertion sites analyses might provide some useful insights into the dwarf mutant formation. {\textcopyright}2012 by the authors.},

abstract = {Targeted genome engineering has emerged as an alternative to classical plant breeding and transgenic methods to improve crop plants. Among other methods (zinc finger nucleases or TAL effector nucleases) the CRISPR-Cas system proved to be the most effective, convenient and least expensive method. In this study, we optimized the conditions of application of this system on apple and explored its feasibility on pear. As a proof of concept, we chose to knockout the Phytoene Desaturase (PDS) and Terminal Flower 1 (TFL1) genes. To improve the edition efficiency, two different single guide RNAs (gRNAs) were associated to the Cas9 nuclease for each target gene. These gRNAs were placed under the control of the U3 and U6 apple promoters. Characteristic albino phenotype was obtained for 85{\%} of the apple transgenic lines targeted in MdPDS gene. Early flowering was observed in 93{\%} of the apple transgenic lines targeted in MdTFL1.1 gene and 9{\%} of the pear transgenic lines targeted in PcTFL1.1. Sequencing of the target zones in apple and pear CRISPR-PDS and CRISPR-TFL1.1 transgenic lines showed that the two gRNAs induced mutations but at variable frequencies. In most cases, Cas9 nuclease cut the DNA in the twenty targeted base pairs near the protospacer adjacent motif and insertions were more frequent than deletions or substitutions. The most frequent edition profile of PDS as well as TFL1.1 genes was chimeric biallelic. Analysis of a sample of potential off-target sequences of the CRISPR-TFL1.1 construct indicated the absence of edition in cases of three mismatches. In addition, transient transformation with the CRISPR-PDS construct produced two T-DNA free edited apple lines. Our overall results indicate that, despite the frequent occurrence of chimerism, the CRISPR-Cas 9 system is a powerful and precise method to induce targeted mutagenesis in the first generation of apple and pear transgenic lines.},

abstract = {Potato breeding can be redirected to a diploid inbred/F1 hybrid variety breeding strategy if self-compatibility can be introduced into diploid germplasm. However, the majority of diploid potato clones (Solanum spp.) possess gametophytic self-incompatibility that is primarily controlled by a single multiallelic locus called the S-locus which is composed of tightly linked genes, S-RNase (S-locus RNase) and multiple SLFs (S-locus F-box proteins), which are expressed in the style and pollen, respectively. Using S-RNase genes known to function in the Solanaceae gametophytic SI mechanism, we identified S-RNase alleles with flower-specific expression in two diploid self-incompatible potato lines using genome resequencing data. Consistent with the location of the S-locus in potato, we genetically mapped the S-RNase gene using a segregating population to a region of low recombination within the pericentromere of chromosome 1. To generate self-compatible diploid potato lines, a dual single-guide RNA (sgRNA) strategy was used to target conserved exonic regions of the S-RNase gene and generate targeted knockouts (KOs) using a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) approach. Self-compatibility was achieved in nine S-RNase KO T 0 lines which contained bi-allelic and homozygous deletions/insertions in both genotypes, transmitting self compatibility to T 1 progeny. This study demonstrates an efficient approach to achieve stable, consistent self-compatibility through S-RNase KO for use in diploid potato breeding approaches.},

abstract = {Trees are used to produce a variety of wood-based products including timber, pulp and paper. More recently, their use as a source of renewable energy has also been highlighted, as has their value for carbon mitigation within the Kyoto Protocol. Relative to food crops, the domestication of trees has only just begun; the long generation time and complex nature of juvenile and mature growth forms are contributory factors. To accelerate domestication, and to understand further some of the unique processes that occur in woody plants such as dormancy and secondary wood formation, a 'model' tree is needed. Here it is argued that Populus is rapidly becoming accepted as the 'model' woody plant and that such a 'model' tree is necessary to complement the genetic resource being developed in arabidopsis. The genus Populus (poplars, cottonwoods and aspens) contains approx. 30 species of woody plant, all found in the Northern hemisphere and exhibiting some of the fastest growth rates observed in temperate trees. Populus is fulfilling the 'model' role for a number of reasons. First, and most important, is the very recent commitment to sequence the Populus genome, a project initiated in February 2002. This will be the first woody plant to be sequenced. Other reasons include the relatively small genome size (450-550 Mbp) of Populus, the large number of molecular genetic maps and the ease of genetic transformation. Populus may also be propagated vegetatively, making mapping populations immortal and facilitating the production of large amounts of clonal material for experimentation. Hybridization occurs routinely and, in these respects, Populus has many similarities to arabidopsis. However, Populus also differs from arabidopsis in many respects, including being dioecious, which makes selfing and back-cross manipulations impossible. The long time-to-flower is also a limitation, whilst physiological and biochemical experiments are more readily conducted in Populus compared with the small-statured arabidopsis. Recent advances in the development of large expressed sequence tagged collections, microarray analysis and the free distribution of mapping pedigrees for quantitative trait loci analysis secure Populus as the ideal subject for further exploitation by a wide range of scientists including breeders, physiologists, biochemists and molecular biologists. In addition, and in contrast to other model plants, the genus Populus also has genuine commercial value as a tree for timber, plywood, pulp and paper. {\textcopyright}2002 Annals of Botany Company.},

Public perception that diverges from the scientific community may decrease the effectiveness of scientific inquiry and innovation as tools to solve these challenges. The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with the divergence of public opinion from scientific consensus regarding the safety of genetically modified (GM) foods and human involvement in global warming (GW). Results indicate that the effects of knowledge on public opinion are complex and non-uniform across types of knowledge (i.e., perceived and actual) or issues. Political affiliation affects agreement with science; Democrats were more likely to agree that GM food is safe and human actions cause GW. Respondents who had relatively higher cognitive function or held illusionary correlations about GM food or GW were more likely to have an opinion that differed from the scientific community.},

Here, we report the deliberate creation of novel site-specific endonucleases by linking two different zinc finger proteins to the cleavage domain of Fok I endonuclease. Both fusion proteins are active and under optimal conditions cleave DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Thus, the modular structure of Fok I endonuclease and the zinc finger motifs makes it possible to create "artificial" nucleases that will cut DNA near a predetermined site.

Average yields range from 20 to 84 $\mu$g/g mature leaf tissue for both wild and cultivated octoploid and diploid Fragaria species.

abstract = {Molecular self-assembly is a powerful approach for fabricating novel supramolecular architectures. It is ubiquitous in the natural world (see Box 1): lipid molecules form oil drops in water; four hemoglobin polypeptides form a functional tetrameric hemoglo-bin protein; ribosomal proteins and RNA coalesce into functional ribosomes. Molecular self-assembly is mediated by weak, noncovalent bonds—notably hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds (electrostatic interac-tions), hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals interactions, and water-mediated hydrogen bonds. Although these bonds are rela-tively insignificant in isolation, when combined together as a whole, they govern the structural conformation of all biological macromol-ecules and influence their interaction with other molecules. The water-mediated hydrogen bond is especially important for living systems, as all biological materials interact with water. All biomolecules, including peptides and proteins, interact and self-organize to form well-defined structures that are associated with functionality 1 . By observing the processes by which supramol-ecular architectures are assembled in nature 1–3 , we can begin to exploit self-assembly for the synthesis of entirely novel synthetic materials. Peptides and proteins are versatile building blocks for fabricating materials. Nature has already used them as scaffolds to produce a dizzying array of materials, including collagen, keratin, pearl, shell, coral and calcite microlenses, and optical waveguides. In this review, I focus on the fabrication of diverse molecular struc-tures through self-assembly of peptides, proteins, and lipids. As the use of genetically engineered polypeptides for specifically binding selected inorganic compounds to assemble functional nanostructures has recently been reviewed 4 , it will not be discussed in detail here. For other aspects of nanomaterials synthesis, namely chemistry-driven approaches to materials synthesis (e.g., self assembly of organic ligands and metal ions into three-dimensional hollow cages or metalloden-drimers) and in vitro systems for artificial protein synthesis, the reader is referred elsewhere 5–8 . Fabrication of nanofibers Work in my laboratory has focused on fabricating several self-assembling peptides and proteins for a variety of studies and biomate-rials (Fig. 1). Examples include ionic self-complementary peptides 9–11 , which form $\beta$-sheet structures in aqueous solution with two distinct surfaces—one hydrophilic, the other hydrophobic (rather like the pegs and holes in Lego bricks). The hydrophobic residues shield themselves from water and self-assemble in water in a manner similar to that seen in the case of protein folding in vivo. The unique structural feature of these 'molecular Lego' peptides is that they form complementary ionic bonds with regular repeats on the hydrophilic surface (Fig. 1a). The complementary ionic sides have been classified into several moduli (modulus I, modulus II, modulus III, modulus IV, etc., and mixtures thereof). This classification scheme is based on the hydrophilic sur-faces of the molecules, which have alternating positively and negatively charged amino acids alternating by one residue, two residues, three residues and so on. For example, charge arrangements for modulus I, modulus II, modulus III and modulus IV are – + – + – + –+, – – + + – – + +, – – – + + + and – – – – + + + +, respectively. The charge},

Developmental regulators and gene-editing reagents are delivered to somatic cells of whole plants. This induces meristems that produce shoots with targeted DNA modifications, and gene edits are transmitted to the next generation.

Genome editing by these methods completely disrupts target genes, thus avoiding weak signals that can occur when transcript abundance is partially decreased by siRNA. Furthermore, gene targeting by the CRISPR system is more precise and appears to produce substantially fewer off-target effects than existing methods.

First, we used the GeCKO library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, we screened for genes whose loss is involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic RAF inhibitor. Our highest-ranking candidates include previously validated genes NF1 and MED12, as well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1.

Given its ability to enhance TRV infection in tobacco, we tested the effect of 126-GFP expression on TRV-mediated virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and demonstrate that this protein can enhance silencing phenotypes. To explain these results, we examined the poorly understood effect of suppressor dosage on the VIGS response and demonstrated that enhanced VIGS corresponds to the presence of low levels of suppressor protein. A mutant version of the 126-kDa protein, inhibited in its ability to suppress silencing, had a minimal effect on VIGS, suggesting that the suppressor activity of the 126-kDa protein is indeed responsible for the observed dosage effects. These findings illustrate the sensitivity of host plants to relatively small changes in suppressor dosage and have implications for those interested in enhancing silencing phenotypes in tobacco and other species through VIGS. {\textcopyright}2008 The American Phytopathological Society.},

A simple technical procedure is described here step-by-step, for the first time, as a routine method for transforming Populus tremula using a disarmed Agrobacterium tumefaciens hypervirulent strain. The procedure begins with the inoculation of stem explants with bacterial suspension, followed by a short period of co-cultivation on a highly regenerative medium. Transformed shoots are selected on regeneration medium containing antibiotics and the presence of the inserted target genes is checked using a rapid and efficient PCR test. Selected shoots are transferred to a rooting medium, under the same selection pressure, and propagated via stem cuttings. Selected plants can be hardened and transferred to the green-house within 4 months of inoculation. The method has proven efficient for several gene constructs, selection on Kan or Hyg, and three different Agrobacterium strains.},

abstract = {Glycosphingolipids (GSL) isolated from the gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-free bacterium Sphingomonas paucimobilis have remarkable structural similarities with LPS and its hydrophobic part, termed lipid A. Like LPS, but in contrast to the structurally related ceramides and cerebrosides, GSL contain an alpha-linked, negatively charged pyranosidic glycosyl component adjacent to the lipid portion and are capable of forming membranes. Because of these similarities, it was of interest to investigate whether these GSL are also able to induce monokine production in human mononuclear cells (MNC). Our results show that a GSL containing four sugar residues (GSL-4A) induced the release of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 in MNC, whereas GSL-1, containing only one glycosyl residue, was inactive. A minimal concentration of 1 microgram of GSL-4A per ml was necessary to induce monokine production in MNC, whereas LPS was as active at a 10,000-fold-lower concentration (0.1 ng/ml). Both GSL-4A-induced monokine production and LPS-induced monokine production were reduced by the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein and GSL-1. In contrast to LPS, GSL-4A-induced monokine release could be inhibited neither by an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody nor by lipid A partial structures. We therefore conclude that at the receptor level, different mechanisms are involved in the LPS- and GSL-4A-induced monokine release.},

abstract = {Root and shoot meristems play essential roles in the formation and development of plant tissues and organs. However, little is known about the roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the regulation of maintenance and differentiation of root and shoot meristems in Populus. Here, we first identified and characterized many microRNAs (miRNAs), mRNAs, long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) from the root tip and shoot tip of poplar at the genome-wide level. A total of 73,012 mRNAs, 13,099 lncRNAs, 47 circRNAs, and 114 miRNAs were identified by strand-specific RNA sequencing and small RNA sequencing. Differential expression analysis revealed that there were 8501 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, 295 DE lncRNAs, 15 DE circRNAs and 45 DE miRNAs, and their functions were annotated. Some lncRNAs and circRNAs have miRNA binding sites, and these ncRNAs may act as functional endogenous pseudo target mimics. Therefore, we constructed lncRNA − peu-miR394a-5p − mRNA, lncRNA − peu-miR166a − mRNA, lncRNA/circRNA − peu-miR396a − mRNA and lncRNA/circRNA − peu-miR160a − PeARF regulatory networks and verified the target genes of these four miRNAs by degradome sequencing. Furthermore, by overexpressing pei-miR160a, we found that pei-miR160a negatively regulated the expression of six PeARFs, five lncRNAs and one circRNA. Our findings provide new insights into the lncRNA/circRNA − miRNA − mRNA networks involved in the development of the root and shoot meristems of Populus.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To evaluate the predictive factors for the development of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants and to study the morbidities associated with the treatment of PDA during the first hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected from the Finnish national register of preterm infants ({\textless}32 gestational weeks) born in 2005-2013. In total, 3668 infants were included. Morbidities during the first hospitalization were analysed and compared between infants who received treatments for the closure of PDA (n = 1132) and infants who received no treatment for PDA (n = 2536). The results were adjusted for the duration of pregnancy, intrauterine growth pattern, antenatal steroids, delivery hospital and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RESULTS RDS and mechanical ventilation were independently associated with an increased risk of PDA requiring treatment. Medical and surgical treatments were associated with the risk of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Primary surgical ligation was associated with an increased risk of severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Medical treatment itself and also followed by surgical ligation was associated with lower mortality. CONCLUSION The severity of lung disease rather than prematurity per se was associated with the development of PDA requiring therapy. Both medical and surgical therapies for PDA were associated with severe BPD, and primary surgical ligation was associated with NEC and severe IVH.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Targeted modification of plant genomes is a powerful strategy for investigating and engineering cellular systems, paving the way for the discovery and development of important, novel agricultural traits. Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease from the type II adaptive immune CRISPR system of the prokaryote Streptococcus pyogenes, has gained widespread popularity as a genome-editing tool for use in a wide array of cells and organisms, including model and crop plants. Effective genome engineering requires the delivery of the Cas9 protein and guide RNAs into target cells. However, in planta genome modification faces many hurdles, including the difficulty in efficiently delivering genome engineering reagents to the desired tissues. We recently developed a Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated genome engineering system for Nicotiana benthamiana. Using this platform, genome engineering reagents can be delivered into all plant parts in a simple, efficient manner, facilitating the recovery of progeny plants with the desired genomic modifications, thus bypassing the need for transformation and tissue culture. This platform expands the utility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for in planta, targeted genome modification. Here, we provide a detailed protocol explaining the methodologies used to develop and implement TRV-mediated genome engineering in N. benthamiana. The protocol described here can be extended to any other plant species susceptible to systemic infection by TRV. However, this approach is not limited to vectors derived from TRV, as other RNA viruses could be used to develop similar delivery platforms.},

For this reason, slowing down the inflammation process becomes very important, and with this purpose non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs are generally used with the subsequent occurrence of adverse side effects. As an alternative in inflammation treatment, folklore medicine has used several plants and herbs with minimal or null side effects, with the phenolic compounds being one of their principal components. Phenolic compounds are able to inhibit either the production or the action of pro-inflammatory mediators, resulting in anti-inflammatory capacity.},

abstract = {Based on wavelet packet and extended Kalman filter (EKF) training RBF neural network method, a method for the fault diagnosis of railway rolling bearing is proposed in this paper. The wavelet packet and RBFNN are introduced. The wavelet packet is used to translate raw vibration signals of a railway rolling bearing into time-scale representation. Then, the wavelet packet energy eigenvector is constructed, next, those wavelet packet energy eigenvectors as fault samples for training RBF neural network. To ameliorate the algorithm, EKF is exploited to optimize the algorithm so as to determine the best values for "network connection weight", finally the fault patterns of the railway rolling bearings are identified. The results show that the proposed method is superior to the RBF neural network in extracting the fault characteristics of roller bearings. This method is effective and can be used for automotive recognition to rotary machine faults. {\textcopyright} 2013 by IFSA.},

KGaA, Weinheim Bacterial microcompartments enclose a biochemical pathway and reactive intermediate within a protein envelope formed by the shell proteins. Herein, the orientation of the propanediol-utilization (Pdu) microcompartment shell protein PduA in bacterial microcompartments and in synthetic nanotubes, and the orientation of PduB in synthetic nanotubes are revealed. When produced individually, PduA hexamers and PduB trimers, tessellate to form flat sheets in the crystal, or they can self-assemble to form synthetic protein nanotubes in solution. Modelling the orientation of PduA in the 20 nm nanotube so as to preserve the shape complementarity and key interactions seen in the crystal structure suggests that the concave surface of the PduA hexamer faces out. This orientation is confirmed experimentally in synthetic nanotubes and in the bacterial microcompartment produced in vivo. The PduB nanotubes described here have a larger diameter, 63 nm, with the concave surface of the trimer again facing out. The conserved concave surface out characteristic of these nano-structures reveals a generic assembly process that causes the interface between adjacent subunits to bend in a common direction that optimizes shape complementarity and minimizes steric clashes. This understanding underpins engineering strategies for the biotechnological application of protein nanotubes.},

abstract = {Key message: WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 11 establishes the acquisition of pluripotencyduring callus formation and accomplishes de novo shoot formation by regulating keytranscription factors in poplar. Abstract: De novo shoot regeneration is a prerequisite for propagation and genetic engineering of elite cultivars in forestry. However, the regulatory mechanism of de novo organogenesis is poorly understood in tree species. We previously showed that WUSCHEL (WUS)-RELATED HOMEOBOX 11 (PtWOX11) of the hybrid poplar clone 84K (Populus alba × P. glandulosa) promotes de novo root formation. In this study, we found that PtWOX11 also regulates de novo shoot regeneration in poplar. The overexpression of PtWOX11 enhanced de novo shoot formation, whereas overexpression of PtWOX11 fused with the transcriptional repressor domain (PtWOX11-SRDX) or reduced expression of PtWOX11 inhibited this process, indicating that PtWOX11 promotes de novo shoot organogenesis. Although PtWOX11 promotes callus formation, overexpression of PtWOX11 and PtWOX11-SRDX also produced increased and decreased numbers of de novo shoots per unit weight, respectively, implying that PtWOX11 promotes de novo shoot organogenesis partially by regulating the intrinsic mechanism of shoot development. RNA-seq and qPCR analysis further revealed that PtWOX11 activates the expression of PLETHORA1 (PtPLT1) and PtPLT2, whose Arabidopsis paralogs establish the acquisition of pluripotency, during incubation on callus-inducing medium. Moreover, PtWOX11 activates the expression of shoot-promoting factors and meristem regulators such as CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (PtCUC2), PtCUC3, WUS and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS to fulfill shoot regeneration during incubation on shoot-inducing medium. These results suggest that PtWOX11 acts as a central regulator of the expression of key genes to cause de novo shoot formation. Our studies further provide a possible means to genetically engineer economically important tree species for their micropropagation.},

abstract = {Background: Biolistic transfection is proving an increasingly popular method of incorporating DNA or RNA into cells that are difficult to transfect using traditional methods. The technique routinely uses 'microparticles', which are {\~{}}1 {\$}\backslashmu{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}m diameter projectiles, fired into tissues using pressurised gas. These microparticles are efficient at delivering DNA into cells, but cannot efficiently transfect small cells and may cause significant tissue damage, thus limiting their potential usefulness. Here we describe the use of 40 nm diameter projectiles - nanoparticles - in biolistic transfections to determine if they are a suitable alternative to microparticles.Results: Examination of transfection efficiencies in HEK293 cells, using a range of conditions including different DNA concentrations and different preparation procedures, reveals similar behaviour of microparticles and nanoparticles. The use of nanoparticles, however, resulted in {\~{}}30{\%} fewer damaged HEK293 cells following transfection. Biolistic transfection of mouse ear tissue revealed similar depth penetration for the two types of particles, and also showed that {\textless}10{\%} of nuclei were damaged in nanoparticle-transfected samples, compared to {\textgreater}20{\%} in microparticle-transfected samples. Visualising details of small cellular structures was also considerably enhanced when using nanoparticles.Conclusions: We conclude that nanoparticles are as efficient for biolistic transfection as microparticles, and are more appropriate for use in small cells, when examining cellular structures and/or where tissue damage is a problem. {\textcopyright}2011 O'Brien and Lummis; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {With the growing demands from a population expected to reach 9 billion people by 2050, it is unclear how our current global food system will meet future food needs. Ensuring that all people have access to adequate and nutritious food produced in an environmentally and socio-culturally sustainable manner is one of the greatest challenges of our time. "Sustainable diets" have been proposed as a multidimensional framework to address the need for nutritious and adequate food in the context of the many challenges facing the world today: reducing poverty and hunger, improving environmental health, enhancing human well-being and health, and strengthening local food networks, sustainable livelihoods and cultural heritage. This paper examines the contribution of forests and trees to sustainable diets, covering among others, nutritional, cultural, environmental and provisioning aspects. The literature reviewed highlight major opportunities to strengthen the contribution of forest and tree foods to sustainable diets. However, several constraints need to be removed. They relate to: cultural aspects, sustainable use of non-wood forest products, organization of forest food provisioning, limited knowledge of forest food composition, challenges in adapting management of forests and trees to account for forest foods, and in integrating forest biodiversity into complex landscapes managed for multiple benefits. Finally, the paper identifies research gaps and makes recommendations to enhance the contribution of forest foods to sustainable diets through increased awareness and better integration of information and knowledge on nutritious forest foods into national nutrition strategies and programs. {\textcopyright}2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Background: Biolistic transfection is proving an increasingly popular method of incorporating DNA or RNA into cells that are difficult to transfect using traditional methods. The technique routinely uses 'microparticles', which are {\~{}}1 {\$}\mu{\$}m diameter projectiles, fired into tissues using pressurised gas. These microparticles are efficient at delivering DNA into cells, but cannot efficiently transfect small cells and may cause significant tissue damage, thus limiting their potential usefulness. Here we describe the use of 40 nm diameter projectiles - nanoparticles - in biolistic transfections to determine if they are a suitable alternative to microparticles.Results: Examination of transfection efficiencies in HEK293 cells, using a range of conditions including different DNA concentrations and different preparation procedures, reveals similar behaviour of microparticles and nanoparticles. The use of nanoparticles, however, resulted in {\~{}}30{\%} fewer damaged HEK293 cells following transfection. Biolistic transfection of mouse ear tissue revealed similar depth penetration for the two types of particles, and also showed that {\textless}10{\%} of nuclei were damaged in nanoparticle-transfected samples, compared to {\textgreater}20{\%} in microparticle-transfected samples. Visualising details of small cellular structures was also considerably enhanced when using nanoparticles.Conclusions: We conclude that nanoparticles are as efficient for biolistic transfection as microparticles, and are more appropriate for use in small cells, when examining cellular structures and/or where tissue damage is a problem. {\textcopyright}2011 O'Brien and Lummis; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Many important biological macromolecules exist as helical polymers. Examples are actin, tubulin, myosin, RecA, Rad51, flagellin, pili, and filamentous bacteriophage. The first application of three-dimensional reconstruction from electron microscopic images was to a helical polymer, and a number of laboratories today are using helical tubes of integral membrane proteins for solving the structure of these proteins in the electron microscope at near atomic resolution. We have developed a method to analyze and reconstruct electron microscopic images of macromolecular helical polymers, the iterative helical real space reconstruction (IHRSR) algorithm. We can show that when there is disorder or heterogeneity, when the specimens diffract weakly, or when Bessel functions overlap, we can do far better with our method than can be done using traditional Fourier-Bessel approaches. In many cases, structures that were not even amenable to analysis can be solved at fairly high resolution using our method. The problems inherent in the traditional approach are discussed, and examples are presented illustrating how the IHRSR approach surmounts these problems. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {Based on wavelet packet and extended Kalman filter (EKF) training RBF neural network method, a method for the fault diagnosis of railway rolling bearing is proposed in this paper. The wavelet packet and RBFNN are introduced. The wavelet packet is used to translate raw vibration signals of a railway rolling bearing into time-scale representation. Then, the wavelet packet energy eigenvector is constructed, next, those wavelet packet energy eigenvectors as fault samples for training RBF neural network. To ameliorate the algorithm, EKF is exploited to optimize the algorithm so as to determine the best values for "network connection weight", finally the fault patterns of the railway rolling bearings are identified. The results show that the proposed method is superior to the RBF neural network in extracting the fault characteristics of roller bearings. This method is effective and can be used for automotive recognition to rotary machine faults. {\textcopyright} 2013 by IFSA.},

The ability to transform maize is a crucial step for application of gene technology in maize improvement. There have been constant improvements in the maize transformation technologies over past several years. The choice of genotype and the explant material to initiate transformation and the different types of media to be used in various stages of tissue culture can have significant impact on the outcomes of the transformation efforts. Various methods of gene transfer, like the particle bombardment, protoplast transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated, in planta transformation, etc., have been tried and improved over years. Similarly, various selection systems for retrieval of the transformants have been attempted. The commercial success of maize transformation and transgenic development is unmatched by any other crop so far. Maize transformation with newer gene editing technologies is opening up a fresh dimension in transformation protocols and work-flows. This review captures the various past and recent facets in improvement in maize transformation technologies and attempts to present a comprehensive updated picture of the current state of the art in this area.},

abstract = {In plants, small RNA-guided processes referred to as RNA silencing control gene expression and serve as an efficient antiviral mechanism. Plant viruses are inducers and targets of RNA silencing as infection involves the production of functional virus-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Here we investigate the structural and genetic components influencing the formation of Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-derived siRNAs. TRV siRNAs are mostly 21 nucleotides in length and derive from positive and negative viral RNA strands, although TRV siRNAs of positive polarity are significantly more abundant. This asymmetry appears not to correlate with the presence of highly structured regions of single-stranded viral RNA. The Dicer-like enzyme DCL4, DCL3, or DCL2 targets, alone or in combination, viral templates to promote synthesis of siRNAs of both polarities from all regions of the viral genome. The heterogeneous distribution profile of TRV siRNAs reveals differential contributions throughout the TRV genome to siRNA formation. Indirect evidence suggests that DCL2 is responsible for production of a subset of siRNAs derived from the 3' end region of TRV. TRV siRNA biogenesis and antiviral silencing are strongly dependent on the combined activity of the host-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases RDR1, RDR2, and RDR6, thus providing evidence that perfectly complementary double-stranded RNA serves as a substrate for siRNA production. We conclude that the overall composition of viral siRNAs in TRV-infected plants reflects the combined action of several interconnected pathways involving different DCL and RDR activities.},

abstract = {Salt stress is one of the most crucial factors impacting plant growth, development and reproduction. However, information regarding differences in tissue-specific gene expression patterns, which may improve a plant's tolerance to salt stress, is limited. Here, we investigated the gene expression patterns in tissues of Populus euphratica Oliv. seedlings using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology. A total of 109.3 million, 125bp paired-end clean reads were generated, and 6428, 4797, 2335 and 3358 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in leaf, phloem, xylem and root tissues, respectively. While the tissue-specific DEGs under salt stress had diverse functions, “membrane transporter activity” was the most significant leaf function, whereas “oxidation–reduction process” was the most significant function in root tissue. Further analysis of the tissue-specific DEGs showed that the expression patterns or functions of gene families, such as SOS, NHX, GolS, GPX, APX, RBOHF and CBL, were diverse, suggesting that calcium signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathways are all involved in ionic homeostasis in tissues from P. euphratica seedlings. The DEGs, for example the up-regulated antioxidant genes, contribute to ROS-scavenging induced by salt stress but result in decreased Na+ concentrations in root vasculature cells and in xylem sap, while the down-regulated rbohF leads to the reverse results. These results suggest that the divergence of DEGs expression patterns contribute to maintenance of ionic and ROS homeostasis in tissues and improve plant salinity tolerance. We comprehensively analyzed the response of P. euphratica seedlings to salt stress and provide helpful genetic resources for studying plant-abiotic stress interactions.},

abstract = {A systematic study was carried out to optimize regeneration and Agrobacteriumtumefaciens-mediated transformation of four common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars; Red Hawk, Matterhorn, Merlot, and Zorro, representing red kidney, great northern, small red, and black bean commercial classes, respectively. Regeneration capacity of leaf explants, stem sections, and embryo axes were evaluated on 30 media each containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium and different combinations of plant growth regulators. For stem sections and leaf explants, none of the media enabled plant regeneration from any of the four cultivars tested, indicating the recalcitrance of bean regeneration from these tissues. In contrast, several media enabled multiple shoot production from embryo axis explants, although optimal regeneration media was genotype-dependent. Under optimal regeneration conditions, multiple shoots, 2.3-10.8 on average for each embryogenic explant, were induced from embryo axis explants at frequencies of 93 {\%} for 'Merlot', 80 {\%} for 'Matterhorn', 73 {\%} for 'Red Hawk', and 67 {\%} for 'Zorro'. Transient expression studies monitored by an intron-interrupted gusA on explants transformed with A. tumefaciens strains GV3101, LBA4404, and EHA105 indicated that all three A. tumefaciens strains tested were efficient in gene delivery. Gene delivery depended on parameters including strain of A. tumefaciens, co-cultivation time, explant type, and bean genotype. Agroinfiltration also enhanced gene delivery. Kanamycin-resistant and GUS-positive calluses were induced from leaf, stem, and embryo axis explants. Chimeric transformants were obtained from embryo axis explants and showed partial GUS-staining. Lack of efficient regeneration from non-meristem containing tissues is the main limitation for stable transformation of common bean. {\textcopyright}2012 Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology and Springer.},

abstract = {Background: Biolistic transfection is proving an increasingly popular method of incorporating DNA or RNA into cells that are difficult to transfect using traditional methods. The technique routinely uses 'microparticles', which are {\~{}}1 $\mu$m diameter projectiles, fired into tissues using pressurised gas. These microparticles are efficient at delivering DNA into cells, but cannot efficiently transfect small cells and may cause significant tissue damage, thus limiting their potential usefulness. Here we describe the use of 40 nm diameter projectiles - nanoparticles - in biolistic transfections to determine if they are a suitable alternative to microparticles.Results: Examination of transfection efficiencies in HEK293 cells, using a range of conditions including different DNA concentrations and different preparation procedures, reveals similar behaviour of microparticles and nanoparticles. The use of nanoparticles, however, resulted in {\~{}}30{\%} fewer damaged HEK293 cells following transfection. Biolistic transfection of mouse ear tissue revealed similar depth penetration for the two types of particles, and also showed that {\textless} 10{\%} of nuclei were damaged in nanoparticle-transfected samples, compared to {\textgreater} 20{\%} in microparticle-transfected samples. Visualising details of small cellular structures was also considerably enhanced when using nanoparticles.Conclusions: We conclude that nanoparticles are as efficient for biolistic transfection as microparticles, and are more appropriate for use in small cells, when examining cellular structures and/or where tissue damage is a problem. {\textcopyright} 2011 O'Brien and Lummis; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The Green Revolution brought modern science to bear on a widening Asian food crisis in the 1960s. The speed and scale with which it solved the food problem was remarkable and unprecedented, and it contributed to a substantial reduction in poverty and the launching of broader economic growth in many Asian countries. Improved cereal varieties, fertilizers, irrigation, and modern pest control methods lay at the heart of the Green Revolution, yet it was much more than a technology fix. It also required a supporting economic and policy environment. The need for markets that could handle the surge in production and the need to educate farmers about the new technology and ensure that they had access to the inputs and receive an adequate reward to their investments, led governments across Asia to actively intervene in launching and implementing the Green Revolution. Government interventions were also important for ensuring that small farmers were included in the revolution and did not get left behind. Even with the success of the Green Revolution, there are remaining social and environmental problems that still need to be resolved and a continuing need to increase yields to meet Asias growing food needs. There is also urgent need to bring the Green Revolution in an appropriately modified form to Sub-Saharan Africa.},

We show that this vector mediates VIGS of endogenous genes in the absence of virus-induced symptoms. Unlike other RNA virus vectors that have been used previously for VIGS, the TRV construct is able to target host RNAs in the growing points of plants. These features indicate that the TRV vector will have wide application for gene discovery in plants.},

This article reports on a biofabrication system based on the hydrodynamically guided co-assembly of peptide amphiphiles (PAs) with naturally occurring biomolecules and proteins to generate hierarchical constructs with tuneable molecular composition and structural control. The system takes advantage of droplet-on-demand inkjet printing to exploit interfacial fluid forces and guide molecular self-assembly into aligned or disordered nanofibers, hydrogel structures of different geometries and sizes, surface topographies, and higher-ordered constructs bound by molecular diffusion. PAs are designed to co-assemble during printing in cell diluent conditions with a range of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and biomolecules including fibronectin, collagen, keratin, elastin-like proteins, and hyaluronic acid. Using combinations of these molecules, NIH-3T3 and adipose derived stem cells are bioprinted within complex structures while exhibiting high cell viability ({\textgreater}88{\%}). By integrating self-assembly with 3D-bioprinting, the study introduces a novel biofabrication platform capable of encapsulating and spatially distributing multiple cell types within tuneable pericellular environments. In this way, the work demonstrates the potential of the approach to generate complex bioactive scaffolds for applications such as tissue engineering, in vitro models, and drug screening.},

This promoter has been engineered by combining a synthetic minimal promoter, Psyn2, and operator sites and the repressor of the Pseudomonas putida F1 cym/cmt system. In the present study, we engineered a vanillate-regulated promoter using Psyn2 and the regulatory elements of the Caulobacter crescentus vanR-vanAB system. We show that the resulting promoter, which we called PV10, responds rapidly to the inducer vanillate with an induction ratio of about two orders of magnitude in Sphingomonas melonis Fr1. In contrast to the switch-like behavior of PQ5, PV10 shows a linear dose-response curve at intermediate vanillate concentrations, allowing graded gene expression. PV10 is functionally compatible with and independent of PQ5 and cumate, and vice versa, suggesting that both systems can be used simultaneously.},

Although Arabidopsis is the most-studied model plant with powerful genetic and genomic resources, achieving highly efficient and consistent transient expression for gene function analysis in Arabidopsis remains challenging.Results: We developed a highly efficient and robust Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system, named AGROBEST (Agrobacterium-mediated enhanced seedling transformation), which achieves versatile analysis of diverse gene functions in intact Arabidopsis seedlings. Using {\$}\backslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation assay, we show that the use of a specific disarmed Agrobacterium strain with vir gene pre-induction resulted in homogenous GUS staining in cotyledons of young Arabidopsis seedlings. Optimization with AB salts in plant culture medium buffered with acidic pH 5.5 during Agrobacterium infection greatly enhanced the transient expression levels, which were significantly higher than with two existing methods. Importantly, the optimized method conferred 100{\%} infected seedlings with highly increased transient expression in shoots and also transformation events in roots of {\~{}}70{\%} infected seedlings in both the immune receptor mutant efr-1 and wild-type Col-0 seedlings. Finally, we demonstrated the versatile applicability of the method for examining transcription factor action and circadian reporter-gene regulation as well as protein subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions in physiological contexts.Conclusions: AGROBEST is a simple, fast, reliable, and robust transient expression system enabling high transient expression and transformation efficiency in Arabidopsis seedlings. Demonstration of the proof-of-concept experiments elevates the transient expression technology to the level of functional studies in Arabidopsis seedlings in addition to previous applications in fluorescent protein localization and protein-protein interaction studies. In addition, AGROBEST offers a new way to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer. {\textcopyright}2014 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

BSMV vectors have previously been shown to be efficient virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) vehicles in barley and wheat and have provided important information about host genes functioning during pathogenesis as well as various aspects of genes functioning in development. To permit more effective use of BSMV VIGS for functional genomics experiments, we have developed an Agrobacterium delivery system for BSMV and have coupled this with a ligation independent cloning (LIC) strategy to mediate efficient cloning of host genes. Infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves provided excellent sources of virus for secondary BSMV infections and VIGS in cereals. The Agro/LIC BSMV VIGS vectors were able to function in high efficiency down regulation of phytoene desaturase (PDS), magnesium chelatase subunit H (ChlH), and plastid transketolase (TK) gene silencing in N. benthamiana and in the monocots, wheat, barley, and the model grass, Brachypodium distachyon. Suppression of an Arabidopsis orthologue cloned from wheat (TaPMR5) also interfered with wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) infections in a manner similar to that of the A. thaliana PMR5 loss-of-function allele. These results imply that the PMR5 gene has maintained similar functions across monocot and dicot families. Our BSMV VIGS system provides substantial advantages in expense, cloning efficiency, ease of manipulation and ability to apply VIGS for high throughput genomics studies. {\textcopyright}2011 Yuan et al.},

abstract = {Most research linking global environmental change and food security focuses solely on agriculture: either the impact of climate change on agricultural production, or the impact of agriculture on the environment, e.g. on land use, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and/or biodiversity. Important though food production is, many other factors also need to be considered to understand food security. A recent international conference on "Environmental Change and Food Security: Bridging Science, Policy and Development for Adaptation" included a range of papers that embraced the multiple dimensions of the food systems that underpin food security. The major conclusion from the conference was that technical fixes alone will not solve the food security challenge. Adapting to the additional threats to food security arising from major environmental changes requires an integrated food system approach, not just a focus on agricultural practices. Six key issues emerged for future research: (i) adapting food systems to global environmental change requires more than just technological solutions to increase agricultural yields; (ii) tradeoffs across multiple scales among food system outcomes are a pervasive feature of globalized food systems; (iii) within food systems, there are some key underexplored areas that are both sensitive to environmental change but also crucial to understanding its implications for food security and adaptation strategies; (iv) scenarios specifically designed to investigate the wider issues that underpin food security and the environmental consequences of different adaptation options are lacking; (v) price variability and volatility often threaten food security; and (vi) more attention needs to be paid to the governance of food systems. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Collective efforts of several laboratories in the past two decades have resulted in the development of various methods for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana. Among these, the floral dip method is the most facile protocol and widely used for producing transgenic Arabidopsis plants. In this method, transformation of female gametes is accomplished by simply dipping developing Arabidopsis inflorescences for a few seconds into a 5{\%} sucrose solution containing 0.01-0.05{\%} (vol/vol) Silwet L-77 and resuspended Agrobacterium cells carrying the genes to be transferred. Treated plants are allowed to set seed which are then plated on a selective medium to screen for transformants. A transformation frequency of at least 1{\%} can be routinely obtained and a minimum of several hundred independent transgenic lines generated from just two pots of infiltrated plants (20-30 plants per pot) within 2-3 months. Here, we describe the protocol routinely used in our laboratory for the floral dip method for Arabidopsis transformation. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants can be obtained in approximately 3 months.},

Activation of quiescent transposable elements and retrotransposons indicate that epigenetic changes occur through the culture process. Epigenetic activation of DNA elements further suggests that epigenetic changes may also be involved in cytogenetic instability through modification of heterochromatin, and as a basis of phenotypic variation through the modulation of gene function. The observation that DNA methylation patterns are highly variable among regenerated plants and their progeny provides evidence that DNA modifications are less stable in culture than in seed-grown plants. Future research will determine the relative importance of epigenetic versus sequence or chromosome variation in conditioning somaclonal variation in plants.},

Results indicate that the effects of knowledge on public opinion are complex and non-uniform across types of knowledge (i.e., perceived and actual) or issues. Political affiliation affects agreement with science; Democrats were more likely to agree that GM food is safe and human actions cause GW.

Although much faster, the transient route is limited by low infectivity of viral vectors carrying average-sized or large genes. We have developed constructs for the efficient delivery of RNA viral vectors as DNA precursors and show here that Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of these constructs results in gene amplification in all mature leaves of a plant simultaneously (systemic transfection). This process, called "magnifection", can be performed on a large scale and with different plant species. This technology combines advantages of three biological systems (the transfection efficiency of A. tumefaciens, the high expression yield obtained with viral vectors, and the post-translational capabilities of a plant), does not require genetic modification of plants and is faster than other existing methods.},

abstract = {Natural resources and environmental quality are in constant decline in parallel with the rapid growth of the world population. Current methods of energy consumption are considered environmentally hazardous and contribute to global warming. To address this rapidly growing concern, development of improved extraction techniques for renewable fuel alternatives is underway. To date, most bioethanol is derived from conventional food and animal feed crops such as corn and sugarcane. A mass shift towards second generation lignocellulosic biomass-derived biofuels will rely on techniques that will enable easy access to plant cell wall components. Lignocellulosic conversion to biofuel requires pretreatment with heat and acid to break the cell wall for effective lignin release. Transgenic plants have been designed for such processes to express reduced or modified lignin for facilitation of saccharification. Plants have been successfully engineered to express enhanced levels of glycoside hydrolases to enable efficient and cost-effective polysaccharide hydrolysis. Furthermore, strategies focusing on increased accessibility of cellulose-degrading enzymes to their substrate have been developed, and rely on cell wall-targeted expression of glycoside hydrolases, cellulose binding modules (CBMs) or other cell wall modifying proteins. A novel approach to cell wall modification comprising the introduction of non-crystalline, soluble polysaccharides to cell walls is discussed. Such approaches will further advance efforts toward establishment of applicable and effective biofuel production methods. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

During the early phase of rapid hybridoma cell growth, assay-based differences in viable cell density were not significant. As the culture aged, the trypan blue dye exclusion assay significantly overestimated cell viability, thereby underestimating nonviable cell density and yielding an erroneous estimation of the overall viability of the culture. Because of its lack of ambiguity in the identification of stained, nonviable cells and its resulting increased accuracy in the estimation of culture viability, the fluorometric assay was considered a better choice for the evaluation of cell viability.},

abstract = {The perennial lifestyle of trees is characterized by seasonal cycles of growth and dormancy. The recurrent transitions into and out of dormancy represent an adaptation mechanism that largely determines survival and, hence, the geographical distribution of tree species. To understand better the molecular basis of bud dormancy, cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) transcript profiling was used to map differential gene expression during dormancy induction, dormancy, dormancy release by chilling, and subsequent bud break in apical buds of poplar (Populus tremulax P. alba). Unexpectedly, besides poplar transcript sequences, the cDNA-AFLP profiles revealed sequence signatures originating from a complex bacterial community, which was more pronounced during dormancy and displayed temporal dynamics in composition and complexity. Based on poplar gene expression dynamics, processes and potential regulators during different phases of dormancy are described. Novel genes were linked to a crucial transitory step in dormancy induction, and to dormancy release through chilling, a molecularly unresolved phenomenon. One WRKY- and two ERF-related transcription factors were similarly expressed during the transition to dormancy in apical and axillary buds. These regulatory genes could be involved in the differentiation of stipule-like leaf organs protecting the bud, or act during the growth-dormancy transition in the meristem, revealing commonalities between para- and endodormancy. {\textcopyright}The Author [2007].

abstract = {Trimethylaminuria, better known as fish odor syndrome, is a psychologically disabling condition in which a patient emits a foul odor, which resembles that of rotting fish. The disorder is most commonly caused by an inherited deficiency in flavin monooxygenase 3, the vital enzyme for the metabolism of trimethylamine, which is the compound responsible for the unpleasant odor. The condition is uncommon, but there has been recent research to suggest that the diagnosis may often be overlooked. Moreover, it is important to be cognizant of this condition because there are reliable diagnostic tests and the disorder can be devastating from a psychosocial perspective. While there is no cure, many simple treatment options exist that may drastically improve the quality of life of these patients. This article will review the literature with an emphasis on the psychosocial impact and treatment options.},

abstract = {Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an effective tool for studying the functions of plant genes, but only a few VIGS vectors available for woody plants were reported so far. Here we present an effective heterologous VIGS system in woody plants based on tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vectors. We first tested whether the TRV-vector can be directly applied to infect woody plant species, such as Vernicia fordii, Populus tomentosa Carr. and Camellia oleifera. The results revealed that TRV-mediated VIGS could be effectively elicited in V. fordii, weakly in P. tomentosa Carr., but not in C. oleifera. TRV-based VIGS vectors with heterologous phytoene desaturase (PDS) sequences from various woody plant species silenced successfully the endogenous PDS gene in Nicotina benthamiana and V. fordii. The photobleached leaf phenotype of silenced plants significantly correlated with the down-regulation of endogenous PDS as compared with controls. To further confirm the reliability of VIGS in V. fordii, we also isolated the cloroplastos alterados 1 gene from P. tomentosa Carr., and the silencing pheotypes of albino leaves were observed in V. fordii 2 weeks after inoculation using a heterologous TRV-based VIGS system. Taken together, we have successfully developed an Agrobacterium-mediated VIGS assay in V. fordii and demonstrated that V. fordii as a heterologous VIGS system provides a valuable tool for functional genomic analysis in woody plant species. {\textcopyright}2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {We have developed a class of peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules that self-assemble into three-dimensional nanofiber networks under physiological conditions in the presence of polyvalent metal ions. The assembly can be triggered by adding PA solutions to cell culture media or other synthetic physiological fluids containing polyvalent metal ions. When the fluids contain suspended cells, PA self-assembly entraps cells in the nanofibrillar matrix, and the cells survive in culture for at least three weeks. We also show that entrapment does not arrest cell proliferation and motility. Biochemical and ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy indicate that entrapped cells internalize the nanofibers and possibly utilize PA molecules in their metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that PA nanofibrillar matrices have the potential to be used for cell transplantation or other tissue engineering applications. {\textcopyright} 2005 Acta Materiala Inc.

abstract = {Plant protoplasts ("naked" cells) provide a unique single cell system to underpin several aspects of modern biotechnology. Major advances in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have stimulated renewed interest in these osmotically fragile wall-less cells. Reliable procedures are available to isolate and culture protoplasts from a range of plants, including both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops. Several parameters, particularly the source tissue, culture medium, and environmental factors, influence the ability of protoplasts and protoplast-derived cells to express their totipotency and to develop into fertile plants. Importantly, novel approaches to maximise the efficiency of protoplast-to-plant systems include techniques already well established for animal and microbial cells, such as electrostimulation and exposure of protoplasts to surfactants and respiratory gas carriers, especially perfluorochemicals and hemoglobin. However, despite at least four decades of concerted effort and technology transfer between laboratories worldwide, many species still remain recalcitrant in culture. Nevertheless, isolated protoplasts are unique to a range of experimental procedures. In the context of plant genetic manipulation, somatic hybridisation by protoplast fusion enables nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes to be combined, fully or partially, at the interspecific and intergeneric levels to circumvent naturally occurring sexual incompatibility barriers. Uptake of isolated DNA into protoplasts provides the basis for transient and stable nuclear transformation, and also organelle transformation to generate transplastomic plants. Isolated protoplasts are also exploited in numerous miscellaneous studies involving membrane function, cell structure, synthesis of pharmaceutical products, and toxicological assessments. This review focuses upon the most recent developments in protoplast-based technologies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The perennial lifestyle of trees is characterized by seasonal cycles of growth and dormancy. The recurrent transitions into and out of dormancy represent an adaptation mechanism that largely determines survival and, hence, the geographical distribution of tree species. To understand better the molecular basis of bud dormancy, cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) transcript profiling was used to map differential gene expression during dormancy induction, dormancy, dormancy release by chilling, and subsequent bud break in apical buds of poplar (Populus tremulax P. alba). Unexpectedly, besides poplar transcript sequences, the cDNA-AFLP profiles revealed sequence signatures originating from a complex bacterial community, which was more pronounced during dormancy and displayed temporal dynamics in composition and complexity. Based on poplar gene expression dynamics, processes and potential regulators during different phases of dormancy are described. Novel genes were linked to a crucial transitory step in dormancy induction, and to dormancy release through chilling, a molecularly unresolved phenomenon. One WRKY- and two ERF-related transcription factors were similarly expressed during the transition to dormancy in apical and axillary buds. These regulatory genes could be involved in the differentiation of stipule-like leaf organs protecting the bud, or act during the growth-dormancy transition in the meristem, revealing commonalities between para- and endodormancy. {\textcopyright}The Author [2007].

abstract = {Robust and reproducible protoplast-to-plant systems are crucial for underpinning genetic manipulation technology involving somatic hybridisation and transformation. Novel and effective approaches for maximising the efficiency of such protoplast cultures include supplementation of media with surfactants and artificial gas carriers, such as perfluorochemicals and haemoglobin. Physical parameters, particularly electrostimulation, also enhance the development of protoplasts and protoplast-derived cells in culture. DNA uptake into protoplasts is now a routine and universally accepted procedure in plant biotechnology for introducing and evaluating both short-term (transient) and long-term (stable) expression of genes in cells and regenerated plants. Importantly, protoplast fusion overcomes pre- and post-zygotic sexual incompatibility barriers and generates novel germplasm through new nuclear-cytoplasmic combinations. In this respect, considerable progress has been made in generating somatic hybrid plants, particularly in citrus, brassicas and potato. Isolated protoplasts are also a unique single cell system for evaluating aspects of ultrastructure, genetics and physiology, with potential for the biosynthesis of novel secondary products, including commercially - important recombinant proteins (e.g. antibodies), and as systems in toxicity screening. Recent advances in protoplast technology have benefited from advances in animal and microbial cell culture, with interesting parallels existing between these systems. Further innovations will necessitate the strengthening of interdisciplinary links in these research fields and the requirement for continued dialogue and co-operation between workers with diverse but complementary skills.},

Utilizing the mechanical and biological advantages of the protein-mimetic peptide (PMP) system, and combining self-assembled PMP nanofibers with other nanomaterials like nanoparticles, the fabricated PMP-based hybrid fibrous nanostructures can serve as promising candidates for advanced technological applications. In this review, we present the design, synthesis, modification, and fabrication of PMP nanofibers by mimicking the properties and functions of several types of proteins, including extracellular matrix proteins, silk proteins, amyloid proteins, and heparin. The sequence and motif design of PMPs, and the relationships between the design of PMP monomers and the fabrication of functional fibrous biomaterials are introduced and discussed. Furthermore, we summarize a basic classification of various peptide motifs, and provide some instructions for the function-based design of peptide nanostructures, in which some issues on the motif design and function tailoring are discussed. Finally, the recent advances in the PMP nanofiber-based functional nanomaterials in biomineralization, cell culture, tissue regeneration, drug delivery, hemostasis, bioimaging, and biosensors are presented in detail. We believe that this review will be very helpful for researchers to understand the property-specific molecular design, controllable supramolecular self-assembly, and motif-specific applications of both peptides and proteins.},

abstract = {The importance of sphingolipids in membrane biology was appreciated early in the twentieth century when several human inborn errors of metabolism were linked to defects in sphingolipid degradation. The past two decades have seen an explosion of information linking sphingolipids with cellular processes. Studies have unraveled mechanistic details of the sphingolipid metabolic pathways, and these findings are being exploited in the development of novel therapies, some now in clinical trials. Pioneering work in yeast has laid the foundation for identifying genes encoding the enzymes of the pathways. The advent of the era of genomics and bioinformatics has led to the identification of homologous genes in other species and the subsequent creation of animal knock-out lines for these genes. Discoveries from these efforts have re-kindled interest in the role of sphingolipids in membrane biology. This review highlights some of the recent advances in understanding sphingolipids' roles in membrane biology as determined from genetic models.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Plant virus-based vectors carrying sequences homologous to endogenous genes trigger  silencing through a homology-dependent RNA degradation mechanism. This phenomenon, called virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), has potential as a powerful reverse-genetics tool in functional genomic programmes through transient, loss-of-function screens. Here, we describe a method to enhance the robustness of the VIGS phenotype by increasing the level of dsRNA molecule production, a critical step in the VIGS response. Incorporation of 40-60 base direct inverted-repeats into a plant viral vector generates RNA molecules that form dsRNA hairpins. A tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-based vector carrying such inverted-repeats, homologous to a green fluorescent protein (gfp) transgene or an endogenous phytoene desaturase (pds) gene, generated a stronger and more pervasive VIGS phenotype than constructs carrying corresponding cDNA fragments in sense or antisense orientation. Real-time RT-PCR indicated that there was up to a threefold reduction in target mRNA accumulation in the tissues where VIGS was triggered by constructs carrying inverted-repeats compared to those where it was triggered by sense or antisense constructs. Moreover, an enhanced VIGS pds phenotype was observed using a different vector, based on barley stripe mosaic virus, in the monocotyledonous host barley. This demonstrates that VIGS can be significantly improved through the inclusion of small inverted-repeats in plant virus-based vectors, generating a more robust loss-of-function phenotype. This suggests that dsRNA formation can be a limiting factor in the VIGS phenomenon.},

abstract = {Trees require a long maturation period, known as juvenile phase, before they can reproduce, complicating their genetic improvement as compared to annual plants. 'Spadona', one of the most important European pear (Pyrus communis L.) cultivars grown in Israel, has a very long juvenile period, up to 14 years, making breeding programs extremely slow. Progress in understanding the molecular basis of the transition to flowering has revealed genes that accelerate reproductive development when ectopically expressed in transgenic plants. A transgenic line of 'Spadona', named Early Flowering-Spadona (EF-Spa), was produced using a MdTFL1 RNAi cassette targeting the native pear genes PcTFL1-1 and PcTFL1-2. The transgenic line had three T-DNA insertions, one assigned to chromosome 2 and two to chromosome 14 PcTFL1-1 and PcTFL1-2 were completely silenced, and EF-Spa displayed an early flowering phenotype: flowers developed already in tissue culture and on most rooted plants 1-8 months after transfer to the greenhouse. EF-Spa developed solitary flowers from apical or lateral buds, reducing vegetative growth vigor. Pollination of EF-Spa trees generated normal-shaped fruits with viable F1 seeds. The greenhouse-grown transgenic F1 seedlings formed shoots and produced flowers 1-33 months after germination. Sequence analyses, of the non-transgenic F1 seedlings, demonstrated that this approach can be used to recover seedlings that have no trace of the T-DNA. Thus, the early flowering transgenic line EF-Spa obtained by PcTFL1 silencing provides an interesting tool to accelerate pear breeding. {\textcopyright}2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Identification of therapeutic strategies to prevent or cure diseases associated with amyloid fibril deposition in tissue (Alzheimer's disease, spongiform encephalopathies, etc.) requires a rational understanding of the driving forces involved in the formation of these organized assemblies rich in beta-sheet structure. To this end, weused a computer-designed algorithm to search for hexapeptide sequences with a high propensity to form homopolymeric beta-sheets. Sequences predicted to be highly favorable on this basis were found experimentally to self-associate efficiently into beta-sheets, whereas point mutations predicted to be unfavorable for this structure inhibited polymerization. However, the property to form polymeric beta-sheets is not a sufficient requirement for fibril formation because, under the conditions used here, preformed beta-sheets from these peptides with charged residues form well defined fibrils only if the total net charge of the molecule is plus/minus 1. This finding illustrates the delicate balance of interactions involved in the formation of fibrils relative to more disordered aggregates. The present results, in conjunction with x-ray fiber diffraction, electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared measurements, have allowed us to propose a detailed structural model of the fibril.},

abstract = {Producing more food for a growing population in the coming decades, while at the same time combating poverty and hunger, is a huge challenge facing African agriculture. The risks that come with climate change make this task more daunting. However, hundreds of thousands of rain fed smallholder farmers in Zambia, Malawi, Niger, and Burkina Faso have been shifting to farming systems that are restoring exhausted soils and are increasing food crop yields, household food security, and incomes. This article reviews these experiences, and their broader implications for African food security, as manifestations of Evergreen Agriculture, a fresh approach to achieving food security and environmental resilience. Evergreen Agriculture is defined as the integration of particular tree species into annual food crop systems. The intercropped trees sustain a green cover on the land throughout the year to maintain vegetative soil cover, bolster nutrient supply through nitrogen fixation and nutrient cycling, generate greater quantities of organic matter in soil surface residues, improve soil structure and water infiltration, increase greater direct production of food, fodder, fuel, fiber and income from products produced by the intercropped trees, enhance carbon storage both above-ground and below-ground, and induce more effective conservation of above- and below-ground biodiversity. Four national cases are reviewed where farmers are observed to be applying these principles on a major scale. The first case involves the experience of Zambia, where conservation farming programmes include the cultivation of food crops within an agroforest of the fertilizer tree Faidherbia albida. The second case is that of the Malawi Agroforestry Food Security Programme, which is integrating fertilizer, fodder, fruit, fuel wood, and timber tree production with food crops on small farms on a national scale. The third case is the dramatic expansion of Faidherbia albida agroforests in millet and sorghum production systems throughout Niger via assisted natural regeneration. The fourth case is the development of a unique type of planting pit technology (zai) along with farmer-managed natural regeneration of trees on a substantial scale in Burkina Faso. Lastly, we examine the current outlook for Evergreen Agriculture to be further adapted and scaled-up across the African continent. {\textcopyright}2010 Springer Science + Business Media B.V. {\&} International Society for Plant Pathology.},

abstract = {Trees from temperate latitudes transition between growth and dormancy to survive dehydration and freezing stress during winter months. We used activation tagging to isolate a dominant mutation affecting release from dormancy and identified the corresponding gene EARLY BUD-BREAK 1 (EBB1). We demonstrate through positioning of the tag, expression analysis, and retransformation experiments that EBB1 encodes a putative APETALA2/Ethylene responsive factor transcription factor. Transgenic up-regulation of the gene caused early bud-flush, whereas down-regulation delayed bud-break. Native EBB1 expression was highest in actively growing apices, undetectable during the dormancy period, but rapidly increased before bud-break. The EBB1 transcript was localized in the L1/L2 layers of the shoot meristem and leaf primordia. EBB1-overexpressing transgenic plants displayed enlarged shoot meristems, open and poorly differentiated buds, and a higher rate of cell division in the apex. Transcriptome analyses of the EBB1 transgenics identified 971 differentially expressed geneswhose expression correlated with the EBB1 expression changes in the transgenic plants. Promoter analysis among the differentially expressed genes for the presence of a canonical EBB1-binding site identified 65 putative target genes, indicative of a broad regulatory context of EBB1 function. Our results suggest that EBB1 has a major and integrative role in reactivation of meristem activity after winter dormancy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Background: Environmental pollution such as exposure to pro-carcinogens including benzo-$\alpha$-pyrene is becoming a major problem globally. Moreover, the effects of benzo-$\alpha$-pyrene (BaP) on drug pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug resistance warrant further investigation, especially in cancer outpatient chemotherapy where exposure to environmental pollutants might occur. Method: We report here on the effects of benzo-$\alpha$-pyrene on esophageal cancer cells in vitro, alone, or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin, 5-flurouracil, or paclitaxel. As the study endpoints, we employed expression of proteins involved in cell proliferation, drug metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycle analysis, colony formation, migration, and signaling cascades in the WHCO1 esophageal cancer cell line after 24 h of treatment. Results: Benzo-$\alpha$-pyrene had no significant effect on WHCO1 cancer cell proliferation but reversed the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs by reducing drug-induced cell death and apoptosis by 30–40{\%} compared to drug-treated cells. The three drugs significantly reduced WHCO1 cell migration by 40–50{\%} compared to control and BaP-treated cells. Combined exposure to drugs was associated with significantly increased apoptosis and reduced colony formation. Evaluation of survival signaling cascades showed that although the MEK-ERK and Akt pathways were activated in the presence of drugs, BaP was a stronger activator of the MEK-ERK and Akt pathways than the drugs. Conclusion: The present study suggest that BaP can reverse the effects of drugs on cancer cells via the activation of survival signaling pathways and upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Our data show that BaP contribute to the development of chemoresistant cancer cells.},

abstract = {Stem cell transplantation offers a potentially transformative approach to treating neurodegenerative disorders. The safety of cellular therapies is established in multiple clinical trials, including our own in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To initiate similar trials in Alzheimer's disease, efficacious cell lines must be identified. Here, we completed a preclinical proof-of-concept study in the APP/PS1 murine model of Alzheimer's disease. Human neural stem cell transplantation targeted to the fimbria fornix significantly improved cognition in two hippocampal-dependent memory tasks at 4 and 16 weeks post-transplantation. While levels of synapse-related proteins and cholinergic neurons were unaffected, amyloid plaque load was significantly reduced in stem cell transplanted mice and associated with increased recruitment of activated microglia. In vitro, these same neural stem cells induced microglial activation and amyloid phagocytosis, suggesting an immunomodulatory capacity. Although long-term transplantation resulted in significant functional and pathological improvements in APP/PS1 mice, stem cells were not identified by immunohistochemistry or PCR at the study endpoint.

abstract = {Amperometric detection of alkaline phosphatase activity has been achieved using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) as the enzyme substrate. The production of hydrogen peroxide from the dephosphorylation of BCIP was measured using an activated carbon electrode with horseradish peroxidase immobilised to its surface by simple passive adsorption. This method was easily capable of measuring 10-12M alkaline phosphatase and had a calculated detection limit of 2{\textperiodcentered}2 × 10-14M. The horseradish peroxidase electrode system was investigated further as a method for non-competitive electrochemical enzyme immunoassay using thyrotropin (TSH) as the model analyte. This was realised by co-immobilization to the electrode surface of both horseradish peroxidase and an anti-thyrotropin monoclonal antibody. After addition of the analyte, a second biotinylated anti-thyrotropin monoclonal antibody and the substrate, streptavidin-labelled alkaline phosphatase was added and the current (generated by enzyme channelling of hydrogen peroxide) measured as a function of TSH concentration. Thus, the activated carbon electrode was used as a combined immunological capture phase and amperometric detection system. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Key message: WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 11 establishes the acquisition of pluripotencyduring callus formation and accomplishes de novo shoot formation by regulating keytranscription factors in poplar. Abstract: De novo shoot regeneration is a prerequisite for propagation and genetic engineering of elite cultivars in forestry. However, the regulatory mechanism of de novo organogenesis is poorly understood in tree species. We previously showed that WUSCHEL (WUS)-RELATED HOMEOBOX 11 (PtWOX11) of the hybrid poplar clone 84K (Populus alba × P. glandulosa) promotes de novo root formation. In this study, we found that PtWOX11 also regulates de novo shoot regeneration in poplar. The overexpression of PtWOX11 enhanced de novo shoot formation, whereas overexpression of PtWOX11 fused with the transcriptional repressor domain (PtWOX11-SRDX) or reduced expression of PtWOX11 inhibited this process, indicating that PtWOX11 promotes de novo shoot organogenesis. Although PtWOX11 promotes callus formation, overexpression of PtWOX11 and PtWOX11-SRDX also produced increased and decreased numbers of de novo shoots per unit weight, respectively, implying that PtWOX11 promotes de novo shoot organogenesis partially by regulating the intrinsic mechanism of shoot development. RNA-seq and qPCR analysis further revealed that PtWOX11 activates the expression of PLETHORA1 (PtPLT1) and PtPLT2, whose Arabidopsis paralogs establish the acquisition of pluripotency, during incubation on callus-inducing medium. Moreover, PtWOX11 activates the expression of shoot-promoting factors and meristem regulators such as CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (PtCUC2), PtCUC3, WUS and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS to fulfill shoot regeneration during incubation on shoot-inducing medium. These results suggest that PtWOX11 acts as a central regulator of the expression of key genes to cause de novo shoot formation. Our studies further provide a possible means to genetically engineer economically important tree species for their micropropagation.},

In this paper, a protocol based on trichloroacetic acid precipitation of peptides and proteins is presented. The method has been tested on four probiotic LAB strains grown in De Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) broth, a complex medium that is often used for the culture of such bacteria. This protocol allowed the detection of 19 proteins after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 10 of them being successfully identified by tandem MS. Thereafter, the 10 were found to be secreted or surface associated by bioinformatic means. In conclusion, this work supplies a method for the identification of proteins secreted by LAB, allowing discrimination between the proteins present in the MRS and those produced by probiotic LAB.},

We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage.

By transforming the Populus hybrid clone "Nanlin895" (Populus deltoides × P. euramericana) with Agrobacterium harboring the PBI121:CarNAC6 binary vector, we showed that the transformation efficiency was improved significantly by multiple independent factors, including an Agrobacterium infective suspension with an OD600 of 0.7, an Agrobacterium infection for 120 min, an Agrobacterium infective suspension at a pH of 5.0, an acetosyringone concentration of 200 {\$}\mu{\$}M, a cocultivation at 28 °C, a cocultivation for 72 h and a sucrose concentration of 30 g/L in the cocultivation medium.

abstract = {Potato breeding can be redirected to a diploid inbred/F1 hybrid variety breeding strategy if self-compatibility can be introduced into diploid germplasm. However, the majority of diploid potato clones (Solanum spp.) possess gametophytic self-incompatibility that is primarily controlled by a single multiallelic locus called the S-locus which is composed of tightly linked genes, S-RNase (S-locus RNase) and multiple SLFs (S-locus F-box proteins), which are expressed in the style and pollen, respectively. Using S-RNase genes known to function in the Solanaceae gametophytic SI mechanism, we identified S-RNase alleles with flower-specific expression in two diploid self-incompatible potato lines using genome resequencing data. Consistent with the location of the S-locus in potato, we genetically mapped the S-RNase gene using a segregating population to a region of low recombination within the pericentromere of chromosome 1. To generate self-compatible diploid potato lines, a dual single-guide RNA (sgRNA) strategy was used to target conserved exonic regions of the S-RNase gene and generate targeted knockouts (KOs) using a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) approach. Self-compatibility was achieved in nine S-RNase KO T 0 lines which contained bi-allelic and homozygous deletions/insertions in both genotypes, transmitting self compatibility to T 1 progeny. This study demonstrates an efficient approach to achieve stable, consistent self-compatibility through S-RNase KO for use in diploid potato breeding approaches.},

abstract = {Trees from temperate latitudes transition between growth and dormancy to survive dehydration and freezing stress during winter months. We used activation tagging to isolate a dominant mutation affecting release from dormancy and identified the corresponding gene EARLY BUD-BREAK 1 (EBB1). We demonstrate through positioning of the tag, expression analysis, and retransformation experiments that EBB1 encodes a putative APETALA2/Ethylene responsive factor transcription factor. Transgenic up-regulation of the gene caused early bud-flush, whereas down-regulation delayed bud-break. Native EBB1 expression was highest in actively growing apices, undetectable during the dormancy period, but rapidly increased before bud-break. The EBB1 transcript was localized in the L1/L2 layers of the shoot meristem and leaf primordia. EBB1-overexpressing transgenic plants displayed enlarged shoot meristems, open and poorly differentiated buds, and a higher rate of cell division in the apex. Transcriptome analyses of the EBB1 transgenics identified 971 differentially expressed geneswhose expression correlated with the EBB1 expression changes in the transgenic plants. Promoter analysis among the differentially expressed genes for the presence of a canonical EBB1-binding site identified 65 putative target genes, indicative of a broad regulatory context of EBB1 function. Our results suggest that EBB1 has a major and integrative role in reactivation of meristem activity after winter dormancy.},

abstract = {Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has been shown to be an effective tool for investigating gene functions in herbaceous plant species, but has rarely been tested in trees. The establishment of a fast and reliable transformation system is especially important for woody plants, many of which are recalcitrant to transformation. In this study, we established a tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based VIGS system for two Populus species, Populus euphratica and P. × canescens. Here, TRV constructs carrying a 266 bp or a 558 bp fragment of the phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene were Agrobacterium-infiltrated into leaves of the two poplar species. Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of the shorter insert, TRV2-PePDS266, into the host poplars resulted in expected photobleaching in both tree species, but not the longer insert, PePDS558. The efficiency of VIGS was temperature-dependent, increasing by raising the temperature from 18 to 28 C. The optimized TRV-VIGS system at 28 C resulted in a high silencing frequency and efficiency up to 65-73 and 83-94{\%}, respectively, in the two tested poplars. Moreover, syringe inoculation of Agrobacterium in 100 mM acetosyringone induced a more efficient silencing in the two poplar species, compared with other agroinfiltration methods, e.g., direct injection, misting and agrodrench. There were plant species-related differences in the response to VIGS because the photobleaching symptoms were more severe in P. × canescens than in P. euphratica. Furthermore, VIGS-treated P. euphratica exhibited a higher recovery rate (50{\%}) after several weeks of the virus infection, compared with TRV-infected P. × canescens plants (20{\%}). Expression stability of reference genes was screened to assess the relative abundance of PePDS mRNA in VIGS-treated P. euphratica and P. × canescens. PeACT7 was stably expressed in P. euphratica and UBQ-L was selected as the most suitable reference gene for P. × canescens using three different statistical approaches, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. Quantitative real-time PCR showed significant reductions in PDS transcripts (55-64{\%}) in the photobleached leaves of both VIGS-treated poplar species. Our results demonstrate that the TRV-based VIGS provides a practical tool for gene functional analysis in Populus sp., especially in those poplar species which are otherwise recalcitrant to transformation.},

abstract = {The localization of the LapA protein to the cell surface is a key step required by Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 to irreversibly attach to a surface and form a biofilm. LapA is a member of a diverse family of predicted bacterial adhesins, and although lacking a high degree of sequence similarity, family members do share common predicted domains. Here, using mutational analysis, we determine the significance of each domain feature of LapA in relation to its export and localization to the cell surface and function in biofilm formation. Our previous work showed that the N terminus of LapA is required for cleavage by the periplasmic cysteine protease LapG and release of the adhesin from the cell surface under conditions unfavorable for biofilm formation. We define an additional critical region of the N terminus of LapA required for LapG proteolysis. Furthermore, our results suggest that the domains within the C terminus of LapA are not absolutely required for biofilm formation, export, or localization to the cell surface, with the exception of the type I secretion signal, which is required for LapA export and cell surface localization. In contrast, deletion of the central repetitive region of LapA, consisting of 37 repeats of 100 amino acids, results in an inability to form a biofilm. We also used single-molecule atomic force microscopy to further characterize the role of these domains in biofilm formation on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. These studies represent the first detailed analysis of the domains of the LapA family of biofilm adhesin proteins.},

These two fragments were ligated by postpolycondensation using polyphosphoric acid as a condensing agent. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and IR measurements revealed that the resulting multiblock polypeptides formed an antiparallel $\beta$-sheet structure with a degree of crystallinity similar to that of spider silk, which resulted in a fibrous morphology.

abstract = {The nucleotide sequence of the luciferase gene from the firefly Photinus pyralis was determined from the analysis of cDNA and genomic clones. The gene contains six introns, all less than 60 bases in length. The 5' end of the luciferase mRNA was determined by both S1 nuclease analysis and primer extension. Although the luciferase cDNA clone lacked the six N-terminal codons of the open reading frame, we were able to reconstruct the equivalent of a full-length cDNA using the genomic clone as a source of the missing 5' sequence. The full-length, intronless luciferase gene was inserted into mammalian expression vectors and introduced into monkey (CV-1) cells in which enzymatically active firefly luciferase was transiently expressed. In addition, cell lines stably expressing firefly luciferase were isolated. Deleting a portion of the 5'-untranslated region of the luciferase gene removed an upstream initiation (AUG) codon and resulted in a twofold increase in the level of luciferase expression. The ability of the full-length luciferase gene to activate cryptic or enhancerless promoters was also greatly reduced or eliminated by this 5' deletion. Assaying the expression of luciferase provides a rapid and inexpensive method for monitoring promoter activity. Depending on the instrumentation employed to detect luciferase activity, we estimate this assay to be from 30- to 1,000-fold more sensitive than assaying chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression.},

abstract = {Plant viruses are biotrophic pathogens that need living tissue for their multiplication and thus, in the infection-defence equilibrium, they do not normally cause plant death. In some instances virus infection may have no apparent pathological effect or may even provide a selective advantage to the host, but in many cases it causes the symptomatic phenotypes of disease. These pathological phenotypes are the result of interference and/or competition for a substantial amount of host resources, which can disrupt host physiology to cause disease. This interference/competition affects a number of genes, which seems to be greater the more severe the symptoms that they cause. Induced or repressed genes belong to a broad range of cellular processes, such as hormonal regulation, cell cycle control and endogenous transport of macromolecules, among others. In addition, recent evidence indicates the existence of interplay between plant development and antiviral defence processes, and that interference among the common points of their signalling pathways can trigger pathological manifestations. This review provides an update on the latest advances in understanding how viruses affect substantial cellular processes, and how plant antiviral defences contribute to pathological phenotypes. {\textcopyright}2011 SGM.},

Due to the high heterozygosity level at 2.1{\%} estimated by k-mer analysis, we exploited TrioCanu for genome assembly. The PacBio clean subreads of P. alba × P. glandulosa were separated into two parts according to the similarities, compared with the parental genomes of P. alba and P. glandulosa. The two parts of the subreads were assembled to two sets of subgenomes comprising subgenome A (405.31 Mb, from P. alba) and subgenome G (376.05 Mb, from P. glandulosa) with the contig N50 size of 5.43 Mb and 2.15 Mb, respectively. A high-quality P. alba × P. glandulosa genome assembly was obtained. The genome size was 781.36 Mb with the contig N50 size of 3.66 Mb and the longest contig was 19.47 Mb. In addition, a total of 176.95 Mb (43.7{\%}), 152.37 Mb (40.5{\%}) of repetitive elements were identified and a total of 38,701 and 38,449 protein-coding genes were predicted in subgenomes A and G, respectively. For functional annotation, 96.98{\%} of subgenome A and 96.96{\%} of subgenome G genes were annotated with public databases.

abstract = {Self-incompatibility (SI) is a complex process, one out of several mechanisms that prevent plants from self-fertilizing to maintain and increase the genetic variability. This process leads to the rejection of the male gametophyte and requires the co-participation of numerous molecules. Plants have evolved two distinct SI systems, the sporophytic (SSI) and the gametophytic (GSI) systems. The two SI systems are markedly characterized by different genes and proteins and each single system can also be divided into distinct subgroups; whatever the mechanism, the purpose is the same, i.e., to prevent self-fertilization. In Malinae, a subtribe in the Rosaceae family, i.e., Pyrus communis and Malus domestica, the GSI requires the production of female determinants, known as S-RNases, which penetrate the pollen tube to interact with the male determinants. Beyond this, the penetration of S-RNase into the pollen tube triggers a series of responses involving membrane proteins, such as phospholipases, intracellular variations of cytoplasmic Ca2+, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered enzymatic activities, such as that of transglutaminase (TGase). TGases are widespread enzymes that catalyze the post-translational conjugation of polyamines (PAs) to different protein targets and/or the cross-linking of substrate proteins leading to the formation of cross-linked products with high molecular mass. When actin and tubulin are the substrates, this destabilizes the cytoskeleton and inhibits the pollen-tube's growth process. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the relationship between S-RNase penetration, TGase activity and cytoskeleton function during GSI in the Malinae.},

However, only in the past two decades has the ability of Agrobacterium to transfer DNA to plant cells been harnessed for the purposes of plant genetic engineering. Since the initial reports in the early 1980s using Agrobacterium to generate transgenic plants, scientists have attempted to improve this "natural genetic engineer" for biotechnology purposes. Some of these modifications have resulted in extending the host range of the bacterium to economically important crop species. However, in most instances, major improvements involved alterations in plant tissue culture transformation and regeneration conditions rather than manipulation of bacterial or host genes. Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is a highly complex and evolved process involving genetic determinants of both the bacterium and the host plant cell. In this article, I review some of the basic biology concerned with Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Knowledge of fundamental biological principles embracing both the host and the pathogen have been and will continue to be key to extending the utility of Agrobacterium for genetic engineering purposes.},

abstract = {Silica skeletal architectures in diatoms are characterized by remarkable morphological and nanostructural details. Silk proteins from spiders and silkworms form strong and intricate self-assembling fibrous biomaterials in nature. We combined the features of silk with biosilica through the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel family of chimeric proteins for subsequent use in model materials forming reactions. The domains from the major ampullate spidroin 1 (MaSp1) protein of Nephila clavipes spider dragline silk provide control over structural and morphological details because it can be self-assembled through diverse processing methods including film casting and fiber electrospinning. Biosilica nanostructures in diatoms are formed in aqueous ambient conditions at neutral pH and low temperatures. The R5 peptide derived from the silaffin protein of Cylindrotheca fusiformis induces and regulates silica precipitation in the chimeric protein designs under similar ambient conditions. Whereas mineralization reactions performed in the presence of R5 peptide alone form silica particles with a size distribution of 0.5-10 {\{}micro{\}}m in diameter, reactions performed in the presence of the new fusion proteins generate nanocomposite materials containing silica particles with a narrower size distribution of 0.5-2 {\{}micro{\}}m in diameter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that composite morphology and structure could be regulated by controlling processing conditions to produce films and fibers. These results suggest that the chimeric protein provides new options for processing and control over silica particle sizes, important benefits for biomedical and specialty materials, particularly in light of the all aqueous processing and the nanocomposite features of these new materials.},

Ensuring that all people have access to adequate and nutritious food produced in an environmentally and socio-culturally sustainable manner is one of the greatest challenges of our time. "Sustainable diets" have been proposed as a multidimensional framework to address the need for nutritious and adequate food in the context of the many challenges facing the world today: reducing poverty and hunger, improving environmental health, enhancing human well-being and health, and strengthening local food networks, sustainable livelihoods and cultural heritage. This paper examines the contribution of forests and trees to sustainable diets, covering among others, nutritional, cultural, environmental and provisioning aspects. The literature reviewed highlight major opportunities to strengthen the contribution of forest and tree foods to sustainable diets. However, several constraints need to be removed. They relate to: cultural aspects, sustainable use of non-wood forest products, organization of forest food provisioning, limited knowledge of forest food composition, challenges in adapting management of forests and trees to account for forest foods, and in integrating forest biodiversity into complex landscapes managed for multiple benefits. Finally, the paper identifies research gaps and makes recommendations to enhance the contribution of forest foods to sustainable diets through increased awareness and better integration of information and knowledge on nutritious forest foods into national nutrition strategies and programs. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Recent reports have highlighted the involvement of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) in the development of angiogenesis in cancer; however, the mechanism and therapeutic value of NOS inhibitors in colon cancer are largely unknown. Objective: In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanism of the NOS inhibitors 1400W and L-NIO on the angiogenesis pathway in colorectal cancer cells. Methods: Two colorectal cancer cell lines, HT 29 and HCT 116, were used for in vitro study. The expression of iNOS and eNOS in cells was knocked down via shRNA transfection. MTS assays and wound healing assays were performed to assess cell proliferation and migration after shRNA transfection or treatment with 1400W, L-NIO, and 5-fluorouracil. Human angiogenesis PCR arrays and proteome profiler human angiogenesis arrays were used to detect changes in key genes/proteins involved in modulating angiogenesis after 1400W and L-NIO treatment. Results: Knockdown of iNOS and eNOS significantly inhibited colorectal cancer cell growth. Treatment with NOS inhibitors inhibited colorectal cancer cell growth and migration, and was associated with suppression of the expression of key genes/proteins involved in the angiogenesis pathway. In addition, the combined use of NOS inhibitors with 5-fluorouracil showed enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation and migration. Conclusion: NOS inhibitors could suppress colorectal cancer cell growth and migration, likely via suppressing the angiogenesis pathway.},

BSMV vectors have previously been shown to be efficient virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) vehicles in barley and wheat and have provided important information about host genes functioning during pathogenesis as well as various aspects of genes functioning in development. To permit more effective use of BSMV VIGS for functional genomics experiments, we have developed an Agrobacterium delivery system for BSMV and have coupled this with a ligation independent cloning (LIC) strategy to mediate efficient cloning of host genes. Infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves provided excellent sources of virus for secondary BSMV infections and VIGS in cereals. The Agro/LIC BSMV VIGS vectors were able to function in high efficiency down regulation of phytoene desaturase (PDS), magnesium chelatase subunit H (ChlH), and plastid transketolase (TK) gene silencing in N. benthamiana and in the monocots, wheat, barley, and the model grass, Brachypodium distachyon. Suppression of an Arabidopsis orthologue cloned from wheat (TaPMR5) also interfered with wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) infections in a manner similar to that of the A. thaliana PMR5 loss-of-function allele. These results imply that the PMR5 gene has maintained similar functions across monocot and dicot families.

abstract = {The Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 126-kDa protein is a suppressor of RNA silencing previously shown to delay the silencing of transgenes in Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana. Here, we demonstrate that expression of a 126-kDa protein-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion (126-GFP) in N. tabacum increases susceptibility to a broad assortment of viruses, including Alfalfa mosaic virus, Brome mosaic virus, Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), and Potato virus X. Given its ability to enhance TRV infection in tobacco, we tested the effect of 126-GFP expression on TRV-mediated virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and demonstrate that this protein can enhance silencing phenotypes. To explain these results, we examined the poorly understood effect of suppressor dosage on the VIGS response and demonstrated that enhanced VIGS corresponds to the presence of low levels of suppressor protein. A mutant version of the 126-kDa protein, inhibited in its ability to suppress silencing, had a minimal effect on VIGS, suggesting that the suppressor activity of the 126-kDa protein is indeed responsible for the observed dosage effects. These findings illustrate the sensitivity of host plants to relatively small changes in suppressor dosage and have implications for those interested in enhancing silencing phenotypes in tobacco and other species through VIGS. {\textcopyright}2008 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract = {Forest trees provide raw materials, help to maintain biodiversity and mitigate the effects of climate change. Certain tree species can also be used as feedstocks for bioenergy production. Achieving these goals may require the introduction or modified expression of genes to enhance biomass production in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner. Tree genetic engineering has advanced to the point at which genes for desirable traits can now be introduced and expressed efficiently; examples include biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, improved wood properties, root formation and phytoremediation. Transgene confinement, including flowering control, may be needed to avoid ecological risks and satisfy regulatory requirements. This and stable expression are key issues that need to be resolved before transgenic trees can be used commercially. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, has contributed substantially to genetic improvements in crops and trees and its physiological basis involves multiple processes. Four associations with the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) indicate its involvement in the regulation of heterosis for shoot growth in maize, sorghum, wheat, rice, tomato and poplar. (1) Inbreds somewhat resemble GA-deficient dwarfs and are often highly responsive to exogenous GA3. (2) Levels of endogenous GAs, including the bioeffector GA1, its precursors GA19 and GA20, and/or its metabolite GA8, are higher in some fast-growing hybrids than parental genotypes. (3) Oxidative metabolism of applied [3H]GAs is more rapid in vigorous hybrids than inbreds, and (4) heterotic hybrids have displayed increased expression of GA biosynthetic genes including GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase. We further investigated Brassica rapa, an oilseed rape, by comparing two inbreds (AO533 and AO539) and their F1 hybrid. Seedling emergence was faster in the hybrid and potence ratios indicated dominance for increased leaf number, area and mass, and stem mass. Overdominance (heterosis) was displayed for root mass, leading to slight heterosis for total plant mass. Stem contents of GA19,20,1 were similar across the Brassica genotypes and increased prior to bolting; elongation was correlated with endogenous GA but heterosis for shoot growth was modest. The collective studies support a physiological role for GAs in the regulation of heterosis for shoot growth in crops and trees, and the Brassica study encourages further investigation of heterosis for root growth.},

The speed and scale with which it solved the food problem was remarkable and unprecedented, and it contributed to a substantial reduction in poverty and the launching of broader economic growth in many Asian countries. Improved cereal varieties, fertilizers, irrigation, and modern pest control methods lay at the heart of the Green Revolution, yet it was much more than a technology fix. It also required a supporting economic and policy environment. The need for markets that could handle the surge in production and the need to educate farmers about the new technology and ensure that they had access to the inputs and receive an adequate reward to their investments, led governments across Asia to actively intervene in launching and implementing the Green Revolution. Government interventions were also important for ensuring that small farmers were included in the revolution and did not get left behind. Even with the success of the Green Revolution, there are remaining social and environmental problems that still need to be resolved and a continuing need to increase yields to meet Asias growing food needs. There is also urgent need to bring the Green Revolution in an appropriately modified form to Sub-Saharan Africa.},

Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated VIGS has been reported for silencing of endogenous genes in many plants. In citrus, analysis of gene function is mainly relied on the table genetic transformation, even though this technique is low-efficiency and time-consuming. In this study, a TRV-mediated VIGS was successfully applied for verification of gene function in citrus. A reporter gene, Magnesium chelatase subunit I (ChlI) from C. grandis was constructed into TRV2 vector to induce gene silencing with visible photobleaching symptom. TRV VIGS induced photobleaching symptom was observed on the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and Citrus after infiltration. The susceptibility to VIGS vector was found to be genotype dependent. Mexican lemon is the most susceptible one. The chlorosis area per leaf was 65.5{\%} of the whole leaf area. GXSTY pummelo exhibited less susceptible to VIGS with only tiny patches of chlorosis appeared on the leaves of treated plants. The parameters were optimized to improve the efficiency. The tiny young leaves and half expanded leaves were more susceptible to VIGS infection. Young seedlings were highly susceptible to vacuum infiltration. The expression of fluorescence from GFP reporter gene was observed in the young seedlings of GXSTY after infiltration with TRV. Close to 100{\%} of infiltration efficiency was achieved by vacuum infiltration. The results indicated that TRV mediated VIGS with vacuum infiltration could be an ideal tool for gene function studies in citrus.},

When ̃3 kb of the 5?flanking regions of close homologs were used to drive expression of the GUSPlus gene, 50-60{\%} of the transgenic events showed expression in apical and axillary meristems. However, expression was also common in other organs, including in leaf veins (40 and 46{\%} of WUS and STM transgenic events, respectively) and hydathodes (56{\%} of WUS transgenic events). Histochemical GUS staining of explants during callogenesis and shoot regeneration using in vitro stems as explants showed that expression was detectable prior to visible shoot development, starting 3-15 days after explants were placed onto callus inducing medium. A minority of WUS and STM events also showed expression in the cambium, phloem, or xylem of regenerated, greenhouse grown plants undergoing secondary growth. Based on microarray gene expression data, a paralog of poplar WUS was detectably up-regulated during shoot initiation, but the other paralog was not. Both paralogs of poplar STM were down-regulated threefold to sixfold during early callus initiation. We identified 15-35 copies of cytokinin response regulator binding motifs (ARR1AT) and one copy of the auxin response element (AuxRE) in both promoters. Several of the events recovered may be useful for studying the process of primary and secondary meristem development, including treatments intended to stimulate meristem development to promote clonal propagation and genetic transformation. {\textcopyright}2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 126-kDa protein is a suppressor of RNA silencing previously shown to delay the silencing of transgenes in Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana. Here, we demonstrate that expression of a 126-kDa protein-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion (126-GFP) in N. tabacum increases susceptibility to a broad assortment of viruses, including Alfalfa mosaic virus, Brome mosaic virus, Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), and Potato virus X. Given its ability to enhance TRV infection in tobacco, we tested the effect of 126-GFP expression on TRV-mediated virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and demonstrate that this protein can enhance silencing phenotypes. To explain these results, we examined the poorly understood effect of suppressor dosage on the VIGS response and demonstrated that enhanced VIGS corresponds to the presence of low levels of suppressor protein. A mutant version of the 126-kDa protein, inhibited in its ability to suppress silencing, had a minimal effect on VIGS, suggesting that the suppressor activity of the 126-kDa protein is indeed responsible for the observed dosage effects. These findings illustrate the sensitivity of host plants to relatively small changes in suppressor dosage and have implications for those interested in enhancing silencing phenotypes in tobacco and other species through VIGS. {\textcopyright}2008 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract = {Fruit trees have a long juvenile phase. For example, the juvenile phase of apple (Malus × domestica) generally lasts for 5-12 years and is a serious constraint for genetic analysis and for creating new apple cultivars through cross-breeding. If modification of the genes involved in the transition from the juvenile phase to the adult phase can enable apple to complete its life cycle within 1 year, as seen in herbaceous plants, a significant enhancement in apple breeding will be realized. Here, we report a novel technology that simultaneously promotes expression of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T gene (AtFT) and silencing of apple TERMINAL FLOWER 1 gene (MdTFL1-1) using an Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) vector (ALSV-AtFT/MdTFL1) to accelerate flowering time and life cycle in apple seedlings. When apple cotyledons were inoculated with ALSV-AtFT/MdTFL1 immediately after germination, more than 90{\%} of infected seedlings started flowering within 1.5-3 months, and almost all early-flowering seedlings continuously produced flower buds on the lateral and axillary shoots. Cross-pollination between early-flowering apple plants produced fruits with seeds, indicating that ALSV-AtFT/MdTFL1 inoculation successfully reduced the time required for completion of the apple life cycle to 1 year or less. Apple latent spherical virus was not transmitted via seeds to successive progenies in most cases, and thus, this method will serve as a new breeding technique that does not pass genetic modification to the next generation. {\textcopyright}2013 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Ensuring that all people have access to adequate and nutritious food produced in an environmentally and socio-culturally sustainable manner is one of the greatest challenges of our time. "Sustainable diets" have been proposed as a multidimensional framework to address the need for nutritious and adequate food in the context of the many challenges facing the world today: reducing poverty and hunger, improving environmental health, enhancing human well-being and health, and strengthening local food networks, sustainable livelihoods and cultural heritage. This paper examines the contribution of forests and trees to sustainable diets, covering among others, nutritional, cultural, environmental and provisioning aspects. The literature reviewed highlight major opportunities to strengthen the contribution of forest and tree foods to sustainable diets. However, several constraints need to be removed. They relate to: cultural aspects, sustainable use of non-wood forest products, organization of forest food provisioning, limited knowledge of forest food composition, challenges in adapting management of forests and trees to account for forest foods, and in integrating forest biodiversity into complex landscapes managed for multiple benefits. Finally, the paper identifies research gaps and makes recommendations to enhance the contribution of forest foods to sustainable diets through increased awareness and better integration of information and knowledge on nutritious forest foods into national nutrition strategies and programs. {\textcopyright}2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Self-incompatibility (SI) is a complex process, one out of several mechanisms that prevent plants from self-fertilizing to maintain and increase the genetic variability. This process leads to the rejection of the male gametophyte and requires the co-participation of numerous molecules. Plants have evolved two distinct SI systems, the sporophytic (SSI) and the gametophytic (GSI) systems. The two SI systems are markedly characterized by different genes and proteins and each single system can also be divided into distinct subgroups; whatever the mechanism, the purpose is the same, i.e., to prevent self-fertilization. In Malinae, a subtribe in the Rosaceae family, i.e., Pyrus communis and Malus domestica, the GSI requires the production of female determinants, known as S-RNases, which penetrate the pollen tube to interact with the male determinants. Beyond this, the penetration of S-RNase into the pollen tube triggers a series of responses involving membrane proteins, such as phospholipases, intracellular variations of cytoplasmic Ca2+, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered enzymatic activities, such as that of transglutaminase (TGase). TGases are widespread enzymes that catalyze the post-translational conjugation of polyamines (PAs) to different protein targets and/or the cross-linking of substrate proteins leading to the formation of cross-linked products with high molecular mass. When actin and tubulin are the substrates, this destabilizes the cytoskeleton and inhibits the pollen-tube's growth process. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the relationship between S-RNase penetration, TGase activity and cytoskeleton function during GSI in the Malinae.},

abstract = {Trees are used to produce a variety of wood-based products including timber, pulp and paper. More recently, their use as a source of renewable energy has also been highlighted, as has their value for carbon mitigation within the Kyoto Protocol. Relative to food crops, the domestication of trees has only just begun; the long generation time and complex nature of juvenile and mature growth forms are contributory factors. To accelerate domestication, and to understand further some of the unique processes that occur in woody plants such as dormancy and secondary wood formation, a 'model' tree is needed. Here it is argued that Populus is rapidly becoming accepted as the 'model' woody plant and that such a 'model' tree is necessary to complement the genetic resource being developed in arabidopsis. The genus Populus (poplars, cottonwoods and aspens) contains approx. 30 species of woody plant, all found in the Northern hemisphere and exhibiting some of the fastest growth rates observed in temperate trees. Populus is fulfilling the 'model' role for a number of reasons. First, and most important, is the very recent commitment to sequence the Populus genome, a project initiated in February 2002. This will be the first woody plant to be sequenced. Other reasons include the relatively small genome size (450-550 Mbp) of Populus, the large number of molecular genetic maps and the ease of genetic transformation. Populus may also be propagated vegetatively, making mapping populations immortal and facilitating the production of large amounts of clonal material for experimentation. Hybridization occurs routinely and, in these respects, Populus has many similarities to arabidopsis. However, Populus also differs from arabidopsis in many respects, including being dioecious, which makes selfing and back-cross manipulations impossible. The long time-to-flower is also a limitation, whilst physiological and biochemical experiments are more readily conducted in Populus compared with the small-statured arabidopsis. Recent advances in the development of large expressed sequence tagged collections, microarray analysis and the free distribution of mapping pedigrees for quantitative trait loci analysis secure Populus as the ideal subject for further exploitation by a wide range of scientists including breeders, physiologists, biochemists and molecular biologists. In addition, and in contrast to other model plants, the genus Populus also has genuine commercial value as a tree for timber, plywood, pulp and paper. {\textcopyright}2002 Annals of Botany Company.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

Silkworms spin silk at the beginning and end of each of their five instar stages, as well as spinning mature silk after the fifth instar. We evaluated the mechanical properties and structure of 10 kinds of silk fibers from different stages. A tensile test showed that instar beginning silk, instar end silk, and mature silk possess distinct properties. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results showed that the excellent mechanical properties of instar end silk are attributed to higher $\beta$-sheet content and suitable crystallinity. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed that P25 protein content in IV-E silk is 2.9 times higher than that of cocoon silk. This study can offer guidelines for further biomimetic investigations into the design and manufacture of artificial silk protein fibers with novel function.},

abstract = {Producing more food for a growing population in the coming decades, while at the same time combating poverty and hunger, is a huge challenge facing African agriculture. The risks that come with climate change make this task more daunting. However, hundreds of thousands of rain fed smallholder farmers in Zambia, Malawi, Niger, and Burkina Faso have been shifting to farming systems that are restoring exhausted soils and are increasing food crop yields, household food security, and incomes. This article reviews these experiences, and their broader implications for African food security, as manifestations of Evergreen Agriculture, a fresh approach to achieving food security and environmental resilience. Evergreen Agriculture is defined as the integration of particular tree species into annual food crop systems. The intercropped trees sustain a green cover on the land throughout the year to maintain vegetative soil cover, bolster nutrient supply through nitrogen fixation and nutrient cycling, generate greater quantities of organic matter in soil surface residues, improve soil structure and water infiltration, increase greater direct production of food, fodder, fuel, fiber and income from products produced by the intercropped trees, enhance carbon storage both above-ground and below-ground, and induce more effective conservation of above- and below-ground biodiversity. Four national cases are reviewed where farmers are observed to be applying these principles on a major scale. The first case involves the experience of Zambia, where conservation farming programmes include the cultivation of food crops within an agroforest of the fertilizer tree Faidherbia albida. The second case is that of the Malawi Agroforestry Food Security Programme, which is integrating fertilizer, fodder, fruit, fuel wood, and timber tree production with food crops on small farms on a national scale. The third case is the dramatic expansion of Faidherbia albida agroforests in millet and sorghum production systems throughout Niger via assisted natural regeneration. The fourth case is the development of a unique type of planting pit technology (zai) along with farmer-managed natural regeneration of trees on a substantial scale in Burkina Faso. Lastly, we examine the current outlook for Evergreen Agriculture to be further adapted and scaled-up across the African continent. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science + Business Media B.V. {\&} International Society for Plant Pathology.},

Here we show that by nanostructuring the sensing electrodes, it is possible to create nucleic acid sensors that have a broad range of sensitivities and that are capable of rapid analysis. Only highly branched electrodes with fine structuring attained attomolar sensitivity. Nucleic acid probes immobilized on finely nanostructured electrodes appear more accessible and therefore complex more rapidly with target molecules in solution. By forming arrays of microelectrodes with different degrees of nanostructuring, we expanded the dynamic range of a sensor system from two to six orders of magnitude. The demonstration of an intimate link between nanoscale sensor structure and biodetection sensitivity will aid the development of high performance diagnostic tools for biology and medicine.},

In principle, a single image of a helical polymer provides all of the different projections needed to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure. Unfortunately, many helical filaments have been refractory to the application of traditional (Fourier-Bessel) methods due to variability, heterogeneity, and weak scattering. Over the past several years, many of these problems have been surmounted using single-particle type approaches that can do substantially better than Fourier-Bessel approaches. Applications of these new methods to viruses, actin filaments, pili and many other polymers show the great advantages of the new methods. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This area had not seen fire since 1910, if not earlier, despite having frequent fire (20-30 year fire return interval) prior to European settlement.

We found that mortality rates were quite low ({\textless}8{\%}) for the larger trees ({\textgreater}20 inches diameter) despite the heavy pre-suppression fuel buildup and recent insect outbreaks.

Membrane fusion is essential to both viral entry and virus-induced cell–cell fusion, a hallmark of henipavirus infections. Elucidiation of the mecha- nism(s) of membrane fusion is critical to understanding henipavirus pathobiology and has the potential to identify novel strategies for the development of antiviral therapeutic agents. Henipavirus membrane fusion requires the coordinated actions of the viral attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Current henipavirus fusion models posit that attachment of NiV or HeV G to its cell surface receptors releases F from its metastable pre-fusion conformation to mediate membrane fusion. The identification of ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 as henipavirus receptors has paved the way for recent advances in our understanding of henipavirus membrane fusion. These advances highlight mechanistic similarities and differences between membrane fusion for the henipavirus and other genera within the Paramyxoviridae family.

abstract = {Recent research in the field of nanometer-scale electronics has focused on the operating principles of small-scale devices and schemes to realize useful circuits. In contrast to established "top-down" fabrication techniques, molecular self-assembly is emerging as a "bottom-up" approach for fabricating nanostructured materials. Biological macromolecules, especially proteins, provide many valuable properties, but poor physical stability and poor electrical characteristics have prevented their direct use in electrical circuits. Here we describe the use of self-assembling amyloid protein fibers to construct nanowire elements. Self-assembly of a prion determinant from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the N-terminal and middle region (NM) of Sup35p, produced 10-nm-wide protein fibers that were stable under a wide variety of harsh physical conditions. Their lengths could be roughly controlled by assembly conditions in the range of 60 nm to several hundred micrometers. A genetically modified NM variant that presents reactive, surface-accessible cysteine residues was used to covalently link NM fibers to colloidal gold particles. These fibers were placed across gold electrodes, and additional metal was deposited by highly specific chemical enhancement of the colloidal gold by reductive deposition of metallic silver and gold from salts. The resulting silver and gold wires were approximately 100 nm wide.

abstract = {ATP-dependent DNA ligases are essential enzymes in both DNA replication and DNA repair processes. Here we report a functional characterization of the T4 DNA ligase. One N-terminal and two C-terminal deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine- tagged proteins. An additional mutant bore a substitution of Lys159 in the active site that abolished ATP binding. All the proteins were tested in biochemical assays for ATP-dependent self-adenylation, DNA binding, nick joining, blunt-end ligation and AMP- dependent DNA relaxation. From this analysis we conclude that binding to DNA is mediated by sequences at both protein ends and plays a key role in the reaction. The enzyme establishes two different complexes with DNA: (i) a transient complex (T.complex) involving the adenylated enzyme; (ii) a stable complex (S.complex) requiring the deadenylated T4 DNA ligase. The formation of an S. complex seems to be relevant during both blunt-end ligation and DNA relaxation. Moreover the inactive His-K159L substitution mutant, although unable to self-adenylate, still possesses AMP-dependent DNA nicking activity.},

abstract = {Agrobacterium tumefaciens and related Agrobacterium species have been known as plant pathogens since the beginning of the 20th century. However, only in the past two decades has the ability of Agrobacterium to transfer DNA to plant cells been harnessed for the purposes of plant genetic engineering. Since the initial reports in the early 1980s using Agrobacterium to generate transgenic plants, scientists have attempted to improve this "natural genetic engineer" for biotechnology purposes. Some of these modifications have resulted in extending the host range of the bacterium to economically important crop species. However, in most instances, major improvements involved alterations in plant tissue culture transformation and regeneration conditions rather than manipulation of bacterial or host genes. Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is a highly complex and evolved process involving genetic determinants of both the bacterium and the host plant cell. In this article, I review some of the basic biology concerned with Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Knowledge of fundamental biological principles embracing both the host and the pathogen have been and will continue to be key to extending the utility of Agrobacterium for genetic engineering purposes.},

abstract = {Nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) is an important regulator of cell survival and has been shown to be constitutively active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Recently, a novel NF-$\kappa$B inhibitor, IMD-0354 (N-(3, 5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxy-benzamide), was shown to specifically inhibit the phosphorylation of I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ by IkB kinases, thus preventing NF-$\kappa$B release. In this study, we investigated if IMD-0354 can inhibit NF-$\kappa$B activation and induce apoptosis in CLL cells in vitro. The rate of increase in apoptosis, drug sensitivity and DNA-binding activity of NF-$\kappa$B were studied using Annexin V stainings, the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively. Finally, the impact of IMD-0354 treatment on the expression of a set of apoptosis-related genes was investigated. The results clearly show that IMD-0354 induced apoptosis (mean 26{\%}, range 8-48{\%}) in CLL cells, independent of immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene mutational status, and showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect. IMD-0354 treatment also significantly lowered the DNA-binding activity of NF-$\kappa$B in CLL cells. In addition, we identified differences in expression levels of pro- and antiapoptotic genes following IMD-0354 treatment. In summary, our novel findings show that IMD-0354 can induce apoptosis in CLL cells, and thus merits further investigation as an anticancer agent in vivo.},

Drought, in particular, represents one of the most important natural factors contributing to malnutrition and famine in many parts of the region. The overall impact of drought on a given country/region and its ability to recover from the resulting social, economic and environmental impacts depends on several factors. The economic, social and environmental impacts of drought are huge in SSA and the national costs and losses incurred threaten to undermine the wider economic and development gains made in the last few decades in the region. There is an urgent need to reduce the vulnerability of countries to climate variability and to the threats posed by climate change. This paper attempts to highlight the challenges of drought in SSA and reviews the current drought risk management strategies, especially the promising technological and policy options for managing drought risks to protect livelihoods and reduce vulnerability. The review suggests the possibilities of several ex ante and ex post drought management strategies in SSA although their effectiveness depends on agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Existing technological, policy and institutional risk management measures need to be strengthened and integrated to manage drought ex ante and to minimize the ex post negative effects for vulnerable households and regions. A proactive approach that combines promising technological, institutional and policy solutions to manage the risks within vulnerable communities implemented by institutions operating at different levels (community, sub-national, and national) is considered to be the way forward for managing drought and climate variability. {\textcopyright}2014 The Authors.},

After a lightning-caused fire swept through the center of the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area in 2003, researchers initiated a comprehensive study along the South Fork of the Flathead River. This study assessed the post-fire survival of over 600 iconic, relict ponderosa pine trees. These trees are of great interest as they are ancient ({\textgreater}400 years old), and some have Native American bark-peeling scars and fire scars. This area had not seen fire since 1910, if not earlier, despite having frequent fire (20-30 year fire return interval) prior to European settlement. Some of the trees sampled in 2003 experienced another fire in 2011 (Hammer Creek Fire). In 2017, these trees were remeasured for post-fire mortality by size class for the fifth time since the 2003 Little Salmon Complex fires. We found that mortality rates were quite low ({\textless}8{\%}) for the larger trees ({\textgreater}20 inches diameter) despite the heavy pre-suppression fuel buildup and recent insect outbreaks. Ponderosa pine mortality rates remained somewhat low ({\textless}24{\%}) throughout the sample period (2003-2017) with the larger trees having the least mortality ({\textless}18{\%}) and the smaller trees having approximately 24{\%} mortality. These surviving large relict ponderosa pine trees continue to thrive in the sampled areas despite a second Hammer Creek wildfire in 2011 that burned in the high fuel loading conditions created by the 2003 Little Salmon Fire.},

Regeneration capacity of leaf explants, stem sections, and embryo axes were evaluated on 30 media each containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium and different combinations of plant growth regulators. For stem sections and leaf explants, none of the media enabled plant regeneration from any of the four cultivars tested, indicating the recalcitrance of bean regeneration from these tissues. In contrast, several media enabled multiple shoot production from embryo axis explants, although optimal regeneration media was genotype-dependent. Under optimal regeneration conditions, multiple shoots, 2.3-10.8 on average for each embryogenic explant, were induced from embryo axis explants at frequencies of 93 {\%} for 'Merlot', 80 {\%} for 'Matterhorn', 73 {\%} for 'Red Hawk', and 67 {\%} for 'Zorro'. Transient expression studies monitored by an intron-interrupted gusA on explants transformed with A. tumefaciens strains GV3101, LBA4404, and EHA105 indicated that all three A. tumefaciens strains tested were efficient in gene delivery. Gene delivery depended on parameters including strain of A. tumefaciens, co-cultivation time, explant type, and bean genotype. Agroinfiltration also enhanced gene delivery. Kanamycin-resistant and GUS-positive calluses were induced from leaf, stem, and embryo axis explants. Chimeric transformants were obtained from embryo axis explants and showed partial GUS-staining. Lack of efficient regeneration from non-meristem containing tissues is the main limitation for stable transformation of common bean. {\textcopyright}2012 Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology and Springer.},

The repetitive sequence of a fibroin protein from major ampullate silk of the spider Nephila clavipes was determined from a partial cDNA clone. The repeating unit is a maximum of 34 amino acids long and is not rigidly conserved. The repeat unit is composed of three different segments: (i) a 6 amino acid segment that is conserved in sequence but has deletions of 3 or 6 amino acids in many of the repeats; (ii) a 13 amino acid segment dominated by a polyalanine sequence of 5-7 residues; (ii) a 15 amino acid, highly conserved segment. The latter is predominantly a Gly-Gly-Xaa repeat with Xaa being alanine, tyrosine, leucine, or glutamine.

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

We propose the term 'functional markers' for DNA markers derived from such functionally characterized sequence motifs. Functional markers are superior to random DNA markers such as RFLPs, SSRs and AFLPs owing to complete linkage with trait locus alleles. We outline the definition, development, application and prospects of functional markers.},

abstract = {A systematic study was carried out to optimize regeneration and Agrobacteriumtumefaciens-mediated transformation of four common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars; Red Hawk, Matterhorn, Merlot, and Zorro, representing red kidney, great northern, small red, and black bean commercial classes, respectively. Regeneration capacity of leaf explants, stem sections, and embryo axes were evaluated on 30 media each containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium and different combinations of plant growth regulators. For stem sections and leaf explants, none of the media enabled plant regeneration from any of the four cultivars tested, indicating the recalcitrance of bean regeneration from these tissues. In contrast, several media enabled multiple shoot production from embryo axis explants, although optimal regeneration media was genotype-dependent. Under optimal regeneration conditions, multiple shoots, 2.3-10.8 on average for each embryogenic explant, were induced from embryo axis explants at frequencies of 93 {\%} for 'Merlot', 80 {\%} for 'Matterhorn', 73 {\%} for 'Red Hawk', and 67 {\%} for 'Zorro'. Transient expression studies monitored by an intron-interrupted gusA on explants transformed with A. tumefaciens strains GV3101, LBA4404, and EHA105 indicated that all three A. tumefaciens strains tested were efficient in gene delivery. Gene delivery depended on parameters including strain of A. tumefaciens, co-cultivation time, explant type, and bean genotype. Agroinfiltration also enhanced gene delivery. Kanamycin-resistant and GUS-positive calluses were induced from leaf, stem, and embryo axis explants. Chimeric transformants were obtained from embryo axis explants and showed partial GUS-staining. Lack of efficient regeneration from non-meristem containing tissues is the main limitation for stable transformation of common bean. {\textcopyright}2012 Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology and Springer.},

abstract = {Somaclonal variation is manifested as cytological abnormalities, frequent qualitative and quantitative phenotypic mutation, sequence change, and gene activation and silencing. Activation of quiescent transposable elements and retrotransposons indicate that epigenetic changes occur through the culture process. Epigenetic activation of DNA elements further suggests that epigenetic changes may also be involved in cytogenetic instability through modification of heterochromatin, and as a basis of phenotypic variation through the modulation of gene function. The observation that DNA methylation patterns are highly variable among regenerated plants and their progeny provides evidence that DNA modifications are less stable in culture than in seed-grown plants. Future research will determine the relative importance of epigenetic versus sequence or chromosome variation in conditioning somaclonal variation in plants.},

@article{Williams2007,
abstract = {The branching order and coherence of the alphaproteobacterial orders have not been well established, and not all studies have agreed that mitochondria arose from within the Rickettsiales. A species tree for 72 alphaproteobacteria was produced from a concatenation of alignments for 104 well-behaved protein families. Coherence was upheld for four of the five orders with current standing that were represented here by more than one species. However, the family Hyphomonadaceae was split from the other Rhodobacterales, forming an expanded group with Caulobacterales that also included Parvularcula. The three earliest-branching alphaproteobacterial orders were the Rickettsiales, followed by the Rhodospirillales and then the Sphingomonadales. The principal uncertainty is whether the expanded Caulobacterales group is more closely associated with the Rhodobacterales or the Rhizobiales. The mitochondrial branch was placed within the Rickettsiales as a sister to the combined Anaplasmataceae and Rickettsiaceae, all subtended by the Pelagibacter branch. Pelagibacter genes will serve as useful additions to the bacterial outgroup in future evolutionary studies of mitochondrial genes, including those that have transferred to the eukaryotic nucleus.},

In some cases, dehydrogeases are able to directly exchange electrons with an appropriately designed electrode surface, without the need for an added redox mediator, allowing bioelectrocatalysis based on a direct electron transfer process. In this review we briefly describe the electron transfer mechanism of dehydrogenase enzymes and some of the characteristics required for bioelectrocatalysis reactions via a direct electron transfer mechanism. Special attention is given to cellobiose dehydrogenase and fructose dehydrogenase, which showed efficient direct electron transfer reactions. An overview of the most recent biosensors and biofuel cells based on the two dehydrogenases will be presented. The various strategies to prepare modified electrodes in order to improve the electron transfer properties of the device will be carefully investigated and all analytical parameters will be presented, discussed and compared.},

abstract = {Fruit trees have a long juvenile phase. For example, the juvenile phase of apple (Malus × domestica) generally lasts for 5-12 years and is a serious constraint for genetic analysis and for creating new apple cultivars through cross-breeding. If modification of the genes involved in the transition from the juvenile phase to the adult phase can enable apple to complete its life cycle within 1 year, as seen in herbaceous plants, a significant enhancement in apple breeding will be realized. Here, we report a novel technology that simultaneously promotes expression of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T gene (AtFT) and silencing of apple TERMINAL FLOWER 1 gene (MdTFL1-1) using an Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) vector (ALSV-AtFT/MdTFL1) to accelerate flowering time and life cycle in apple seedlings. When apple cotyledons were inoculated with ALSV-AtFT/MdTFL1 immediately after germination, more than 90{\%} of infected seedlings started flowering within 1.5-3 months, and almost all early-flowering seedlings continuously produced flower buds on the lateral and axillary shoots. Cross-pollination between early-flowering apple plants produced fruits with seeds, indicating that ALSV-AtFT/MdTFL1 inoculation successfully reduced the time required for completion of the apple life cycle to 1 year or less. Apple latent spherical virus was not transmitted via seeds to successive progenies in most cases, and thus, this method will serve as a new breeding technique that does not pass genetic modification to the next generation. {\textcopyright}2013 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Transgenic technology is a powerful tool for gene functional characterization, and poplar is a model system for genetic transformation of perennial woody plants. However, the poplar genetic transformation system is limited to a number of model genotypes. Herein, we developed a transformation system based on efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for the hybrid poplar Populus Alba × Populus glandulosa Uyeki, which is a fast-growing poplar species that is suitably grown in the northern part of China. Importantly, we optimized many independent factors and showed that the transformation efficiency was improved significantly using juvenile leaf explants. Explants were infected by an Agrobacterium suspension with the OD600 = 0.6 for 15 min and then co-cultured in dark conditions for 3 days. Using the improved transformation system, we obtained the transgenic poplar with overexpression of $\beta$-glucuronidase (GUS) via direct organogenesis without callus induction. Furthermore, we analyzed the GUS gene in the transgenic poplars using PCR, qRT-PCR, and GUS staining. These analyses revealed that the GUS gene was efficiently transformed, and it exhibited various expression levels. Taken together, these results represent a simple, fast, and efficient transformation system of hybrid poplar plants. Our findings may facilitate future studies of gene functions in perennial woody plants and tree breeding via transgenic technology assisted design.},

abstract = {Plant biotechnology relies on two approaches for delivery and expression of heterologous genes in plants: stable genetic transformation and transient expression using viral vectors. Although much faster, the transient route is limited by low infectivity of viral vectors carrying average-sized or large genes. We have developed constructs for the efficient delivery of RNA viral vectors as DNA precursors and show here that Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of these constructs results in gene amplification in all mature leaves of a plant simultaneously (systemic transfection). This process, called "magnifection", can be performed on a large scale and with different plant species. This technology combines advantages of three biological systems (the transfection efficiency of A. tumefaciens, the high expression yield obtained with viral vectors, and the post-translational capabilities of a plant), does not require genetic modification of plants and is faster than other existing methods.},

abstract = {Robust and reproducible protoplast-to-plant systems are crucial for underpinning genetic manipulation technology involving somatic hybridisation and transformation. Novel and effective approaches for maximising the efficiency of such protoplast cultures include supplementation of media with surfactants and artificial gas carriers, such as perfluorochemicals and haemoglobin. Physical parameters, particularly electrostimulation, also enhance the development of protoplasts and protoplast-derived cells in culture. DNA uptake into protoplasts is now a routine and universally accepted procedure in plant biotechnology for introducing and evaluating both short-term (transient) and long-term (stable) expression of genes in cells and regenerated plants. Importantly, protoplast fusion overcomes pre- and post-zygotic sexual incompatibility barriers and generates novel germplasm through new nuclear-cytoplasmic combinations. In this respect, considerable progress has been made in generating somatic hybrid plants, particularly in citrus, brassicas and potato. Isolated protoplasts are also a unique single cell system for evaluating aspects of ultrastructure, genetics and physiology, with potential for the biosynthesis of novel secondary products, including commercially - important recombinant proteins (e.g. antibodies), and as systems in toxicity screening. Recent advances in protoplast technology have benefited from advances in animal and microbial cell culture, with interesting parallels existing between these systems. Further innovations will necessitate the strengthening of interdisciplinary links in these research fields and the requirement for continued dialogue and co-operation between workers with diverse but complementary skills.},
